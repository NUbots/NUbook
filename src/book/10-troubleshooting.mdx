**Shared folders are not mounted?**

If the shared folders are not mounted you may need to run the following command on the host machine.

```bash
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
```

**Multiple nubotsvm in NUsight?**

This means someone else is also running a vm robot. You can modify the name of your vm robot by doing the following.

```bash
cd build
nano config/NetworkConfiguration.yaml
```

**During vagrant provision, dpkg is locked?**

This procedure should resolve most issues that may cause the dpkg to be locked (the lock file is like a mutex). Pay attention to the output of the apt-get commands and look for any further errors.

```bash
vagrant ssh
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock
sudo apt-get install -f
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
exit
vagrant provision
```

Optional step: Run this after the "apt-get upgrade" command. This isn't necessary to resolve any problems, it will just free up some hard drive space.

```bash
sudo apt-get autoremove --purge
```

**Vagrant provision stopped on Grub?**

Grub requires user input when updating but vagrant does not support the format it uses. To fix this, do ‘CTRL-C’ twice to stop the process. Run the following commands to update inside the vm and then exit to provision again.

```bash
ssh vagrant
sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend /var/lib/dpkg/lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock /var/cache/debconf/templates.dat /var/cache/debconf/passwords.dat /var/cache/debconf/config.dat
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt dist-upgrade
sudo apt autoremove --purge
exit
vagrant provision
```

**Something is wrong with the VM?**

If your problem does not match any of the above, try exiting the VM and in your NUbots folder run 

```bash
vagrant provision
```
