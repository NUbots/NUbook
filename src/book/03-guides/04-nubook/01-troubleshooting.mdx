## Why is my newly added page is not showing up?

When you add a new page, you should remove the gatsby build `.cache` and `public` folder:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public
```

## Why am I getting weird errors when I run `yarn dev`?

Usually this happens when there's a problem with one or more packages in `node_modules`. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `yarn` again

```sh
rm -rf node_modules && yarn
```

Then try running `yarn dev` again.
