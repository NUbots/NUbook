## Why is my newly added page not showing up?

When you add a new page, you should remove the Gatsby `.cache` and `public` folders, by running:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public
```

And then try building again:

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Why am I getting weird errors when I run `yarn dev`?

Usually this happens when there is a problem with one or more packages in the `node_modules` folder. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `yarn` to reinstall dependencies:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules && yarn
```

Then try building again:

```sh
yarn dev
```

## Why am I getting errors from Prettier when running `yarn dev`? / Why can't I push to GitHub?

If a page you have added or changed is not formatted correctly, your changes may not show up in the NUbook preview, and you will not be able to push to GitHub.

To fix this, run:

```sh
yarn format --fix
```

## Why are my changes not showing up in NUbook?

First, make sure you have saved the file, then refresh NUbook in the browser to see if your changes show up.

If you have created a new page or added a new image, you may need to remove the `.cache` and `public` folders. To do so, run:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public
```

And then try building again:

```sh
yarn dev
```
