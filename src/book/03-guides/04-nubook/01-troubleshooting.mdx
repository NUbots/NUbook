## Why is my newly added page is not showing up?

When you add a new page, you should remove the Gatsby cache and public folders:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public
```

## Why am I getting weird errors when I run `yarn dev`?

Usually this happens when there's a problem with one or more packages in `node_modules`. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `yarn` to reinstall dependencies:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules && yarn
```

Then try running `yarn dev` again.

## Why am I getting errors from Prettier when running `yarn dev`? / Why can't I push to GitHub?

If a page is not formatted correctly, changes to that page may not show up in the NUbook preview, and you will not be able to push to GitHub. To fix this, run:

```sh
yarn format --fix
```

## Why are my changes not showing up in NUbook?

Make sure you have saved the file.

If you have created a new page or added a new image, you may need to remove the `.cache` and `public` folders. To do so, run:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public && yarn dev
```
