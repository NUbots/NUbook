## Why is my newly added page is not showing up?

When you add a new page, you should remove the gatsby build `.cache` and `public` folder:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public
```

## Why am I getting weird errors when I run `yarn dev`?

Usually this happens when there's a problem with one or more packages in `node_modules`. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `yarn` again

```sh
rm -rf node_modules && yarn
```

Then try running `yarn dev` again.

## I am getting errors from 'Prettier' when running `yarn dev`! / I can't push to GitHub!

If NUbook is not formatted correctly, you may not see any changes appear NUbook, and you will not be able to push to GitHub. To fix this, run:

```bash
yarn format --fix
```

## My change is not showing up in NUbook!

Make sure you have saved the file.

If you have created a new page or added a new image, you may need to remove the `.cache` and `public` folder. run

```bash
rm -rf .cache public && yarn dev
```
