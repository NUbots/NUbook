This is a guide for how to contribute to NUsight. To see what NUsight can do check out [here](/system/tools/nusight). This guide assumes you have NUsight built and are familar with using it.

## Yarn Commands

| Command              | Use                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `./b yarn`           | Installs dependencies for NUsight                                                                   |
| `./b yarn build`     | Build the NUsight codebase - Used when you make changes                                             |
| `./b yarn prod`      | Run NUsight on a local server to test changes (You will need to connect with your own NUbots image) |
| `./b yarn start`     | Combines the `build` and `start` commands for a live update (Refresh browser)                       |
| `./b yarn dev`       | Starts NUsight with some generic robots running a repeated pattern for some development testing     |
| `./b yarn storybook` | Builds and starts a debug environment for NUsight using Stories to perform component tests          |

## Creating a new tab in NUsight

All components for NUsight live in the `src/client/components` directory. The process to create a new tab is as follows

1. Copy one of the existing tab's subdirectories and rename it.

2. Set up `network.ts` to determine the format of the data that you will be receiving from NUClear and passing to your subcomponents

3. Create sub components for the tab

4. Work on the top level `view.ts`, `model.ts`, and `style.css` documents to finalise the entire tab

5. Edit `src/client/main.tsx` to include both an `import` command and an `install` command

## Creating a sub component for a tab

1. Subcomponents work together in a tab to provide the full functionality. These should be subdirectories in the main tab's directory. It is recommended to copy an existing sub component to ensure you include everything

2. A subcomponent is typically made up of 3 files. `model.ts` is a TypeScript file which handles the interpretation of one or more NUClear protos, and handles any calculations that goes along with preparing it for display. `view.tsx` is a React file which takes the data from `model.ts` and formats it ready for display. `style.css` is used to provide custom stylisation

3. A subcomponent should also include Stories which allow for unit testing under different use cases. These are found in the `stories` directory of each subcomponent

## Stories
Creating stories allows you to run component tests as you work to ensure that everything is running as expected. Stories are created with the `.stories.tsx` extension. Running `./b yarn storybook` will automatically include any files with this extension.

There are several different kinds of Stories in the NUsight codebase and you can learn more about them [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction)
