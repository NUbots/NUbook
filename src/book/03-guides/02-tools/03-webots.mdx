[Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) is a physics environment created by Cyberbotics. This guide details how to set up Webots. It gives instructions on setting up Ubuntu (WSL) inside Windows for Windows users, and the rest of the guide is aimed at Ubuntu users (including Windows WSL Ubuntu users).

## Prerequisites

<details>

<summary>Windows</summary>

1. Follow the instructions for setting up Ubuntu in WSL on the [Getting Started NUbook page under the Windows tab in the Docker section](/guides/main/getting-started#docker).

2. Since Webots uses a GUI, we will need to set up a way to launch and display the program. Use [these instructions](https://medium.com/@chuckdries/installing-gitkraken-in-wsl-2-15bf6459f823) which is for a similar scenario, but with GitKraken instead of Webots. **Take note of the following changes**:

   - You can ignore installing and launching GitKraken. Instead, we will use the Webots instructions later in this guide to install and launch Webots.

   - When running XLaunch configuration, **uncheck 'Native opengl'** on the third window.

   - To prevent having to set the DISPLAY environment variable every time, run the following command in Ubuntu:

     ```sh
     echo 'export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '\''{print $2; exit;}'\''):0.0' >> ~/.bashrc
     ```

   <Alert type='info'>

   To be able to copy and paste into the Ubuntu terminal, right-click on the bar at the top of the Ubuntu window. Then click on **Properties**, and enable **Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste** in the **Options** tab. Note that this is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd> not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd>.

   </Alert>

3. In Ubuntu run

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xfixes0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xkb1 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxkbcommon0
   ```

<Alert type='info'>

You will need XLaunch running every time you want to run Webots.

</Alert>

Follow the rest of the steps on this page within Ubuntu.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Arch Linux </summary>

1. Run `pacman -S --needed git lsb-release cmake swig glu glib2 freeimage freetype2 libxml2 libzip boost-libs gd libgcrypt libzip readline pbzip2 pciutils wget zip unzip jdk-openjdk libusb` to obtain the required dependencies.

2. Download our [usb patch](assets/usb.patch) which helps the makefile link libusb properly.

3. After you do the clone step below, move the patch file `usb.patch` into your webots install folder, and run `git apply usb.patch` inside that folder to apply it. After that, you should be able to `make -j$(nproc)` as usual.

Install libraries for cmake, protobuf, eigen, and yaml-cpp:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libeigen3-dev libyaml-cpp-dev
```

## Install Webots

To install Webots, use the instructions on the [Webots GitHub repository](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation). After running the `git clone` command in the guide, run `git checkout develop`. Follow these instructions inside Ubuntu (WSL) if you are a Windows user. See the previous section on how to set this up. The optional dependencies are not required. Note that you must clone the Webots directory into your home folder. To move to your home folder, run `cd ~`.

## Get and Build the NUbots Environment

1. Open a terminal. Clone the [NUbots/NUWebots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots/) repository and move into it by running

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots
   cd NUWebots
   ```

2. Compile the controllers with cmake

   1. Make a build folder and move into it

      ```sh
      mkdir build && cd build
      ```

   2. Configure and generate the build files

      ```sh
      cmake ..
      ```

   3. Compile the code

      ```sh
      make -j$(nproc)
      ```

## Running Webots

1. Navigate to the Webots folder

   ```sh
   cd ~/webots
   ```

2. Launch Webots by running

   ```sh
   ./webots
   ```

3. Open the NUbots world file inside Webots.

   1. Click on `File->Open World...`.

   2. In the pop-up, navigate to the [NUbots/NUWebots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots/) repository on your computer and open the `worlds/kid.wbt` world file.

## Creating a New Controller

From the root of the NUWebots repository run

```sh
python3 ./scripts/create_controller.py <name of controller>
```

Where `<name of controller>` is the name you want to use for the new controller. A folder and files will be created with this name, so they must be valid file names (don't use spaces in your controller name).
