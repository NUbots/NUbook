[Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) is a physics environment created by Cyberbotics. This guide details how to set up Webots. It gives instructions on setting up Ubuntu (WSL) inside Windows for Windows users, and the rest of the guide is aimed at Ubuntu users (including Windows WSL Ubuntu users).

## Prerequisites

<details>

<summary>Windows</summary>

1. Follow the instructions for setting up Ubuntu in WSL on the [Getting Started NUbook page under the Windows tab in the Docker section](/guides/main/getting-started#docker).

2. Since Webots uses a GUI, we will need to set up a way to launch and display the program. Use [these instructions](https://medium.com/@chuckdries/installing-gitkraken-in-wsl-2-15bf6459f823) which is for a similar scenario, but with GitKraken instead of Webots. **Take note of the following changes**:

   - You can ignore installing and launching GitKraken. Instead, we will use the Webots instructions later in this guide to install and launch Webots.

   - When running XLaunch configuration, **uncheck 'Native opengl'** on the third window.

   - To prevent having to set the DISPLAY environment variable every time, run the following command in Ubuntu:

     ```sh
     echo 'export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '\''{print $2; exit;}'\''):0.0' >> ~/.bashrc
     ```

   <Alert type='info'>

   To be able to copy and paste into the Ubuntu terminal, right-click on the bar at the top of the Ubuntu window. Then click on **Properties**, and enable **Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste** in the **Options** tab. Note that this is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd> not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd>.

   </Alert>

3. In Ubuntu run

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xfixes0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xkb1 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxkbcommon0
   ```

<Alert type='info'>

You will need XLaunch running every time you want to run Webots.

</Alert>

Follow the rest of the steps on this page within Ubuntu.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Arch Linux </summary>

1. Run the following to obtain the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   pacman -S --needed git lsb-release cmake swig glu glib2 freeimage freetype2 libxml2 libzip boost-libs gd libgcrypt libzip readline pbzip2 pciutils wget zip unzip jdk-openjdk libusb
   ```

2. Download our [usb patch](assets/webots_usb.patch) which helps the makefile link `libusb` properly.

3. After you do the clone step below, move the patch file `webots_usb.patch` into your webots install folder, and run `git apply webots_usb.patch` inside that folder to apply it. After that, you should be able to run `make -j$(nproc)` as usual.

</details>

Install libraries for cmake, protobuf, eigen, yaml-cpp, ninja-build, and clang-tidy:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libeigen3-dev libyaml-cpp-dev ninja-build clang-tidy python3-dev libjpeg9-dev
```

## Install Webots

1. Open a terminal and swap to your home directory (note that Webots should be cloned in your home directory). Then clone the repository and change into the cloned directory:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone --branch nubots-changes --single-branch --recurse-submodules -j$(nproc) https://github.com/NUbots/webots.git
   cd webots
   ```

   By using these commands, you'll be on the correct branch (`nubots-changes`) and you'll have the required submodules.

2. Install Webots build dependencies:

   ```sh
   sudo ./scripts/install/linux_compilation_dependencies.sh
   ```

3. Build Webots:

   ```sh
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

4. Add the `WEBOTS_HOME` env variable to your `.bashrc` file:

   ```
   echo WEBOTS_HOME=$HOME/webots >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

5. Install dependencies for the referee:

   ```sh
   cd ~/webots/projects/samples/contests/robocup/controllers/referee
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Build the Robocup controllers:

   ```sh
   cd ~/webots/projects/samples/contests/robocup
   WEBOTS_HOME=$HOME/webots make -j$(nproc)
   ```

## Install Game Controller

1. Install the ant build tool:

   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install ant default-jdk
   ```

2. Clone the Robocup TC GameController repo:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/GameController.git
   ```

3. Change into the cloned directory and build the GameController:

   ```sh
   cd GameController
   ant
   ```

## Get and Build the NUbots Environment

1. Open a terminal. Clone the [NUbots/NUWebots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots/) repository and move into it by running

   ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots.git
   cd NUWebots
   ```

2. Install the python dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the codebase by running

   ```sh
   ./b configure
   ```

   <details>

   <summary> Optional Flags </summary>
   We can configure with several optional flags as follows:

   ```sh
   ./b configure [-i] [-- <flags>]
   ```

   where `-i` runs an interactive configuration with `ccmake`, and `<flags>` can be any valid cmake command line flag. Some useful cmake flags are:

   | Flag                              | Effect                                                                                                         | Default             |
   | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
   | `-DUSE_ASAN=ON`                   | Compile with [address sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html)                            | `OFF`               |
   | `-DUSE_UBSAN=ON`                  | Compile with [undefined behaviour sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html)      | `OFF`               |
   | `-DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=ON`          | Analyse the code being compiled with [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)                    | `OFF`               |
   | `-DWEBOTS_HOME=path/to/webots`    | Tells the compiler where webots is (usually implicitly set by environment variable)                            | `/usr/local/webots` |
   | `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build type>` | Tells the compiler what type of build type to use, out of {`Release`, `Debug`, `MinSizeRel`, `RelWithDebInfo`} | `Release`           |

   </details>

4. Build the codebase by running

   ```sh
   ./b build
   ```

## Running Webots

1. Navigate to the Webots folder

   ```sh
   cd ~/webots
   ```

2. Launch Webots by running

   ```sh
   ./webots
   ```

3. Open the NUbots world file inside Webots.

   1. Click on `File->Open World...`.

   2. In the pop-up, navigate to the [NUbots/NUWebots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots/) repository on your computer and open the `worlds/kid.wbt` world file.

## Running Webots with GameController

1. Find your primary local IP address by running the following.

   ```sh
   hostname -I
   ```

   Your primary IP address will usually be the first of the addresses in the output returned. For example, if `hostname -I` returns `10.1.0.207 10.1.0.139 172.17.0.1`, use `10.1.0.207`.

2. Set the `GAME_CONTROLLER_UDP_FILTER` env variable to your local IP address from step 1, to ensure your instance of GameController is not affected by other instances of GameController on the network.

   ```sh
   export GAME_CONTROLLER_UDP_FILTER=<IP_ADDRESS> # replace <IP_ADDRESS> with your IP address from step 1
   ```

3. Run the following to open Webots with the Robocup world and the GameController:

   ```sh
   JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java WEBOTS_HOME=$HOME/webots GAME_CONTROLLER_HOME=$HOME/GameController ~/webots/webots ~/webots/projects/samples/contests/robocup/worlds/robocup.wbt
   ```

   <Alert>

   Sometimes closing Webots doesn't properly close the GameController subprocess. If this happens you'll get an error about GameController when you next launch Webots. To fix, run the following command which terminates the GameController process, then start Webots again:

   ```sh
   kill -9 $(pgrep -fi GameControllerSimulator.jar)
   ```

   </Alert>

## Creating a New Controller

From the root of the NUWebots repository run

```sh
python3 ./scripts/create_controller.py <name of controller>
```

Where `<name of controller>` is the name you want to use for the new controller. A folder and files will be created with this name, so they must be valid file names (don't use spaces in your controller name).
