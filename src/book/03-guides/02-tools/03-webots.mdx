Webots is a physics environment created by Cyberbotics. This guide details how to set up Webots. It gives instructions on setting up Ubuntu (WSL) inside Windows for Windows users, and the rest of the guide is aimed at Ubuntu users (including Windows WSL Ubuntu users).

## Prerequisites

<details>

<summary>Windows</summary>

1. Follow the instructions for setting up Ubuntu in WSL on the [Getting Started NUbook page under the Windows tab in the Docker section](/guides/main/getting-started#docker).

2. Since Webots uses a GUI, we will need to set up a way to launch and display the program. Use [these instructions](https://medium.com/@chuckdries/installing-gitkraken-in-wsl-2-15bf6459f823) which is for a similar scenario, but with GitKraken instead of Webots. **Take note of the following changes**:

   - You can ignore installing and launching GitKraken. Instead, we will use the Webots instructions later in this guide to install and launch Webots. **Do not** skip the step under 'Installing GitKraken' where you set the DISPLAY environment variable - the other steps are not necessary, but this one is.

   - When running XLaunch configuration, **uncheck 'Native opengl'** on the third window.

   <Alert type='info'>

   To be able to copy and paste into the Ubuntu terminal, right-click on the bar at the top of the Ubuntu window. Then click on **Properties**, and enable **Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste** in the **Options** tab. Note that this is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd> not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd>.

   </Alert>

3. In Ubuntu run

   ```sh
   sudo apt install libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xfixes0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xkb1 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxkbcommon0
   ```

Follow the rest of the steps on this page within Ubuntu.

## Install Webots

To install Webots, use the instructions on the [Webots GitHub repository](https://github.com/cyberbotics/webots/wiki/Linux-installation). Follow these instructions inside Ubuntu (WSL) if you are a Windows user. See the previous section on how to set this up. The optional dependencies are not required.

## Get and Build the NUbots Environment

1. Open a terminal. Clone the [NUbots/Webots](https://github.com/NUbots/Webots/) repository and move into it by running

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/NUbots/Webots
   cd Webots
   ```

2. Compile the controllers with cmake

   1. Make a build folder and move into it

   ```sh
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

   2. Configure and generate the build files

   ```sh
   cmake ..
   ```

   3. Compile the code

   ```sh
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

## Running Webots

1. Launch Webots by running

   ```sh
   ./webots
   ```

2. Open the NUbots world file inside Webots.

   1. Click on `File->Open World...`.

   2. In the pop-up, navigate to the [NUbots/Webots](https://github.com/NUbots/Webots/) repository on your computer and open the `worlds/kid.wbt` world file.

## Creating a New Controller

From the root of this repositry run

```sh
python3 ./scripts/create_controller.py <name of controller>
```

Where `<name of controller>` is the name you want to use for the new controller. A folder and files will be created with this name, so they must be valid file names (don't use spaces in your controller name).
