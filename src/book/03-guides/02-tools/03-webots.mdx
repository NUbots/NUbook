[Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) is a physics environment created by Cyberbotics. This guide details how to set up Webots. It gives instructions on setting up Ubuntu (WSL) inside Windows for Windows users, and the rest of the guide is aimed at Ubuntu users (including Windows WSL Ubuntu users).

## Prerequisites

<details>

<summary>Windows</summary>

1. Follow the instructions for setting up Ubuntu in WSL on the [Getting Started NUbook page under the Windows tab in the Docker section](/guides/main/getting-started#docker).

2. Since Webots uses a GUI, we will need to set up a way to launch and display the program. Use [these instructions](https://medium.com/@chuckdries/installing-gitkraken-in-wsl-2-15bf6459f823) which is for a similar scenario, but with GitKraken instead of Webots. **Take note of the following changes**:

   - You can ignore installing and launching GitKraken. Instead, we will use the Webots instructions later in this guide to install and launch Webots.

   - When running XLaunch configuration, **uncheck 'Native opengl'** on the third window.

   - To prevent having to set the DISPLAY environment variable every time, run the following command in Ubuntu:

     ```bash
     echo 'export DISPLAY=$(cat /etc/resolv.conf | grep nameserver | awk '\''{print $2; exit;}'\''):0.0' >> ~/.bashrc
     ```

   <Alert type='info'>

   To be able to copy and paste into the Ubuntu terminal, right-click on the bar at the top of the Ubuntu window. Then click on **Properties**, and enable **Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste** in the **Options** tab. Note that this is <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd> not <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>/<kbd>V</kbd>.

   </Alert>

3. In Ubuntu run

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-image0 libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-xfixes0 libxcb-xinerama0 libxcb-xkb1 libxkbcommon-x11-0 libxkbcommon0
   ```

<Alert type='info'>

You will need XLaunch running every time you want to run Webots.

</Alert>

Follow the rest of the steps on this page within Ubuntu.

</details>

<details>

<summary> Arch Linux </summary>

1. Run the following to obtain the required dependencies.

   ```bash
   pacman -S --needed git lsb-release cmake swig glu glib2 freeimage freetype2 libxml2 libzip boost-libs gd libgcrypt libzip readline pbzip2 pciutils wget zip unzip jdk-openjdk libusb
   ```

2. Download our [usb patch](assets/webots_usb.patch) which helps the makefile link `libusb` properly.

3. After you do the clone step below, move the patch file `webots_usb.patch` into your webots install folder, and run `git apply webots_usb.patch` inside that folder to apply it. After that, you should be able to run `make -j$(nproc)` as usual.

</details>

Install libraries for cmake, protobuf, eigen, yaml-cpp, ninja-build, and clang-tidy:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libeigen3-dev libyaml-cpp-dev ninja-build clang-tidy python3-dev libjpeg9-dev
```

## Install Webots

1. Open a terminal, clone the NUWebots repository and change into the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone --recurse-submodules -j$(nproc) https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots.git
   cd NUWebots
   ```

   The NUWebots repo contains both NUbots-specific Webots files and the files needed to install Webots itself.
   The first command can be changed to any directory you would like. If you're not sure, just follow what is in this guide.

2. This step assumes you have done the previous step and are now in the NUWebots directory. Add the `WEBOTS_HOME` env variable to your `.bashrc` file:

   ```
   echo export WEBOTS_HOME=$(pwd)/webots >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. Move into the webots directory and install the Webots build dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd webots
   sudo ./scripts/install/linux_compilation_dependencies.sh
   ```

4. Build Webots:

   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

## Running the Official RoboCup Simulation in Webots

### Set Up the Protos

1. Set up the symlink for the NUgus proto:

   ```bash
   ln -s $WEBOTS_HOME/../protos/robot/NUgus $WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/contests/robocup/protos
   ```

   This allows us to use our NUgus robot with the official RoboCup simulation.

### Set Up the Controllers

1. Install dependencies for the referee:

   ```bash
   cd $WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/contests/robocup/controllers/referee
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Build the Robocup controllers:

   ```bash
   cd $WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/contests/robocup
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```

### Install Game Controller

1. Install the ant build tool and Java Development Kit:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ant default-jdk
   ```

2. Clone the Robocup TC GameController repo:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/GameController.git
   ```

   The first command can be changed to any directory you would like. If you're not sure, just follow what is in this guide.

3. Change into the cloned directory and build the GameController:

   ```bash
   cd GameController
   ant
   ```

4. Add the `JAVA_HOME` and `GAME_CONTROLLER_HOME` env variable to your `.bashrc` file:

   ```bash
   echo export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java >> ~/.bashrc
   echo export GAME_CONTROLLER_HOME=$(pwd) >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   The second command assumes you are still in the GameController directory from the previous step.

### Run Webots with GameController

1. Find your primary local IP address by running the following.

   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

   Your primary IP address is often the first of the addresses in the output returned. For example, if `hostname -I` returns `10.1.0.207 10.1.0.139 172.17.0.1`, use `10.1.0.207`.

2. Set the `GAME_CONTROLLER_UDP_FILTER` env variable to your local IP address from step 1 to ensure your instance of GameController is not affected by other instances of GameController on the network.

   ```bash
   export GAME_CONTROLLER_UDP_FILTER=<IP_ADDRESS> # replace <IP_ADDRESS> with your IP address from step 1
   ```

3. Run the following to open Webots with the Robocup world and the GameController:

   ```bash
   $WEBOTS_HOME/webots $WEBOTS_HOME/projects/samples/contests/robocup/worlds/robocup.wbt
   ```

   <Alert>

   Sometimes closing Webots doesn't properly close the GameController subprocess. If this happens you'll get an error about GameController when you next launch Webots. To fix, run the following command which terminates the GameController process, then start Webots again:

   ```bash
   kill -9 $(pgrep -fi GameControllerSimulator.jar)
   ```

   </Alert>

### Running One Robot

If you want to test the behaviour of one robot in the Webots RoboCup scenario, you can run the binary from the usual NUbots docker container. The robot can be run on the same computer or on a different computer to the Webots simulator.

1. Use the [Getting Started page](/guides/main/getting-started) to set up the codebase, configure and build if not done so already. When configuring, ensure that `ROLE_webotsrobocup` is `ON`.

2. Set your UDP filter on the NUbots side to prevent it from receiving conflicting GameController packets. Go to the [GameController configuration file](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/module/input/GameController/data/config/GameController.yaml) and set `udp_filter_address` to the `<IP_ADDRESS>` from the previous section in step 2.

3. Ensure the IP and ports are set up correctly. If you are running everything locally on the one computer, the default settings should work. If Webots and the robot code are run on separate computers, do the following

   1. As done previously, get the hostname of each computer by running `hostname -I` in the terminal.

   2. On the computer you will be running the robot code on, run `./b edit config/webots.yaml` and change the IP in `server_address` to the hostname of the Webots simulator computer found in the previous step.

   3. On the computer you will be running the Webots simulator on, open the `NUWebots` repo in

Should say something about making sure you have the right stuff in `webots.yaml` for IP and port, and in GameController for team id and robot id. Also that on the webots side, the referee or whatever it is has the address of the robot computer if they are different.

4. Run `./b run webotsrobocup`.

### Running Multiple Robots

If you're running more than one robot, you will need to set up a Docker container for each robot. There can be any combination of different or same computers for each robot container and webots itself. E.g. you can run webots itself and a robot on one computer, three robots on another computer, and three on another computer. Just the more computers you have, the more complicated the IP set up will be for the config files.

1. Use the [Getting Started page](/guides/main/getting-started) to set up the codebase, configure and build if not done so already. When configuring, ensure that `ROLE_webotsrobocup` is `ON`.

2. Set your UDP filter on the NUbots side to prevent it receiving conflicting GameController packets. Go to the [GameController configuration file](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/module/input/GameController/data/config/GameController.yaml) and set `udp_filter_address` to the `<IP_ADDRESS>` from the previous section in step 2.

3. Something about right ips on the webots side.

4. Run `./b webots build webotsrobocup` to build the container with the `webotsrobocup` role.

5. Run `docker container run --rm --network=host -e ROBOCUP_ROBOT_ID=<ROBOT_ID> -e ROBOCUP_TEAM_COLOR=<TEAM_COLOUR> -e ROBOCUP_SIMULATOR_ADDR=<WEBOTS_IP>:<ROBOT_PORT> robocup-vhsc-nubots:robocup2021 webotsrobocup>`

   E.g. if you are running everything locally on one computer, and you want to connect to robot number 1 on the red team, run
   `docker container run --rm --network=host -e ROBOCUP_ROBOT_ID=1 -e ROBOCUP_TEAM_COLOR=red -e ROBOCUP_SIMULATOR_ADDR=127.0.0.1:10001 robocup-vhsc-nubots:robocup2021 webotsrobocup>`

6. Open a new terminal and run the above command with different `<ROBOT_ID>`, `<TEAM_COLOUR>` and `<ROBOT_PORT>` combinations for each robot.

## Get and Build the NUbots Environment

1. Open a terminal. Clone the [NUbots/NUWebots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots/) repository and move into it by running

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots.git
   cd NUWebots
   ```

2. Install the python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure the codebase by running

   ```bash
   ./b configure
   ```

   <details>

   <summary> Optional Flags </summary>
   We can configure with several optional flags as follows:

   ```bash
   ./b configure [-i] [-- <flags>]
   ```

   where `-i` runs an interactive configuration with `ccmake`, and `<flags>` can be any valid cmake command line flag. Some useful cmake flags are:

   | Flag                              | Effect                                                                                                         | Default             |
   | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
   | `-DUSE_ASAN=ON`                   | Compile with [address sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html)                            | `OFF`               |
   | `-DUSE_UBSAN=ON`                  | Compile with [undefined behaviour sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html)      | `OFF`               |
   | `-DENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=ON`          | Analyse the code being compiled with [clang-tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)                    | `OFF`               |
   | `-DWEBOTS_HOME=path/to/webots`    | Tells the compiler where webots is (usually implicitly set by environment variable)                            | `/usr/local/webots` |
   | `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<build type>` | Tells the compiler what type of build type to use, out of {`Release`, `Debug`, `MinSizeRel`, `RelWithDebInfo`} | `Release`           |

   </details>

4. Build the codebase by running

   ```bash
   ./b build
   ```

## Running Webots

1. Navigate to the Webots folder

   ```bash
   cd ~/webots
   ```

2. Launch Webots by running

   ```bash
   ./webots
   ```

3. Open the NUbots world file inside Webots.

   1. Click on `File->Open World...`.

   2. In the pop-up, navigate to the [NUbots/NUWebots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUWebots/) repository on your computer and open the `worlds/kid.wbt` world file.

## Creating a New Controller

From the root of the NUWebots repository run

```bash
./b controller generate <name of controller>
```

Where `<name of controller>` is the name you want to use for the new controller. A folder and files will be created with this name, so they must be valid file names (don't use spaces in your controller name).
