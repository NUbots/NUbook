Information on how NUpbr works can be found on the [NUpbr system page](/system/tools/nupbr). This guide has been written for Ubuntu and Ubuntu-like systems.

## Setting Up Blender

1. Download [Blender 2.93](https://www.blender.org/download/lts/2-93/). Click on the Linux link, as shown below.

   ![Blender download link](./images/blender-download.png 'The Blender 2.93 download page highlighting the Linux option.')

2. Create a Blender folder and extract the tar file into it. This assumes the tar you downloaded is inside the `Downloads` folder.

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /opt/blender
   sudo tar -Jxf ~/Downloads/blender-2.93.13-linux-x64.tar.xz --strip-components=1 -C /opt/blender

   ```

3. Make sure you can see the Blender files inside the folder by running `ls /opt/blender` in a terminal.

4. Test that you can run Blender by running `/opt/blender/blender` in a terminal.

5. Set up your computer so you can access Blender from the menu and with the `blender` command. If you have multiple versions of Blender installed, you may want to skip this step and only open Blender for NUpbr using `/opt/blender/blender`.

   1. Open the config file

      ```bash
      sudo gedit /opt/blender/blender.desktop
      ```

   2. Find the lines starting with `Exec` and `Icon` and change those lines to

      ```bash
      Exec=/opt/blender/blender %f
      Icon=/opt/blender/blender.svg
      ```

   3. To be able to run Blender using just `blender`, run

      ```bash
      echo alias blender=/opt/blender/blender >> ~/.bashrc
      ```

6. Install libraries for Blender

   ```bash
   sudo /opt/blender/2.93/python/bin/python3.9 -m ensurepip
   sudo /opt/blender/2.93/python/bin/python3.9 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   sudo /opt/blender/2.93/python/bin/python3.9 -m pip install opencv-contrib-python
   ```

## GPU Support (Optional)

Running NUpbr with a GPU is generally quicker than with a CPU. You can skip this step if you want to run on CPU.

To run on GPU, you need to ensure that your computer has the correct GPU drivers installed. This depends on your manufacturer. On an NVIDIA GPU, `nvidia-smi` will tell you the driver you are using. It can also be used to check if Blender is using the GPU.

If Blender is not using the GPU, then you may need to edit your Blender settings. Open Blender and go to `Edit > Preferences > System`. Under `Compute Device`, select `CUDA`. If you have multiple GPUs, you can select which one to use here.

## Setting Up NUpbr

1. Clone the repository and navigate into the folder

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NUbots/NUpbr.git
   cd NUpbr
   ```

2. Download the [resources.zip](http://10.1.0.223:8080/share.cgi?ssid=05GE7Tx) file from the NUbots NAS and copy the resources directory from it into the NUpbr root directory. A more comprehensive resources folder can be found on the NAS.

   <Alert>

   To access the download, you need to be in the NUbots lab and connected to the local network. QNAP cloud can be used to connect to the NAS remotely.

   </Alert>

3. Set up the configuration. This often just involves setting the number of images to generate in [output_config.py](https://github.com/NUbots/NUpbr/blob/main/pbr/config/output_config.py).

4. Run NUpbr using

   ```bash
   blender --python pbr/pbr.py
   ```

   NUpbr can also be run in headless mode with

   ```bash
   blender -b --python pbr/pbr.py
   ```

## Adding New HDRs

HDRs are high dynamic range images. Each robot soccer field we encounter should be added to our HDR library for diversity and variety! However, it is not straightforward and it is easy to end up with normal JPGs rather than true HDR images.

### Capture the HDR

The Ricoh Theta is a 360 degree camera capable of capture the data needed to create HDR images. 

- Download the app (todo add info). This is only available on the Apple Store.
- Place the Ricoh Theta on a camera stand roughly at the height of the robot.
- Place the camera and stand configuration on the soccer field.
- The app should allow remote capture. Move off the field and capture the HDR. This will take a while, since the camera is collecting multiple images at various exposures. Refrain from movements and anyone walking onto the field, as this will result in ghosting effects on the end HDR. 
- Repeat across the field in multiple locations for variety. 

Ensure that the theta camera contains images of varying brightness for each capture. There should be about 6-7 images ranging from very dark to very bright. This collection of images for the same capture will be converted into a HDR.

### Converting the Images to a HDR

The easiest method is to use Adobe Lightroom on Windows. A free 7-day trial is available at the time of writing, which includes Lightroom and Photoshop. Download both locally.

- Import the images for one HDR into Lightroom
- Select all images, right click on the selection and go to "Photo > Photo Merge > HDR". You shouldn't need to adjust any parameters. 
- Do not save the resulting HDR image. It will not save as a true HDR. Instead, right click and choose "Edit in Photoshop".
- In Photoshop, there is a 'remove object tool' that does not use AI credits. Use this tool to remove the camera stand in the image.
- Save the image as a HDR. The image will be several MB if it is a HDR, as opposed to less than a MB if it has incorrectly saved as a normal JPG. 
- Delete the images in Lightroom and repeat the steps for the next HDR image set.

On Linux, use [Luminance HDR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/qtpfsgui/). GIMP may be used to manually remove the camera stand using the heal tool.

### Segment the HDR

Drag the HDR into an empty instance of GIMP. It will appear as a layer. Make a new layer and segment (colour in) each object class.

- Red (255, 0, 0) for balls
- Blue for robots (0,0,255)
- Yellow for goal posts (255,255,0)
- Green for field (0,255,0)
- White for field lines (255,255,255)
- Black for background (0,0,0)

Colours have to be exact. Configure both the lasso and pencil tool to not use antialiasing.

### Position in the world

This is done manually. You may be able to get the IMU data from the original images from the theta. Otherwise copy a JSON file from an existing NUpbr HDR and modify the rotation until it looks reasonable when generated in NUpbr. Modify the the vertical axis (y-axis in Blender) until the height looks reasonable.
