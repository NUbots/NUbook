GameController is the official match control software used in RoboCup competitions to manage robot soccer games â€” including timing, game phases, penalties, and more. This guide covers the setup of the **Rust + Tauri** version of the GameController, which replaces the older [Java-based version](https://github.com/RoboCup-SPL/GameController) previously used in SPL and the Humanoid League.

## Platform Notes

- This guide assumes a Linux environment with GUI support is available, as GameController requires a graphical interface.

- For **Windows** users:

  - On **Windows 11**, GUI support is built-in via **WSLg**.
  - On **Windows 10**, or for more control, use tools like **XLaunch**, as described in the **Prerequisites** section from [here](/guides/tools/webots-setup).

- For **macOS** users:
  - Install equivalent dependencies using **Homebrew**.
  - Note that GUI behavior and windowing may differ slightly from Linux.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Rust and add Cargo to your shell environment:

   ```bash
   curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

2. Install required system dependencies

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev libsoup2.4-dev \
   libpango1.0-dev libcairo2-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libjavascriptcoregtk-4.0-dev \
   clang libclang-dev llvm-dev
   ```

3. (Optional) Install a modern Node.js version

   <Alert type='warning'>

   Required if your system Node.js is missing or older than v18

   </Alert>

   ```bash
   # Remove outdated Node.js if installed
   sudo apt remove --purge nodejs npm
   sudo apt autoremove

   # Install Node Version Manager (nvm)
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
   source ~/.bashrc

   # Install latest LTS Node.js and activate it
   nvm install --lts
   nvm use --lts
   ```

## Building and Running GameController

1. Clone the RoboCup TC GameController repo and move into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/GameController
   cd GameController
   ```

2. Build the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm ci
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

3. Build GameController:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. Run GameController:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/game_controller_app
   ```

## Using the GameController

- After launching the application, a graphical interface should appear.
- For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the [official README](https://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/GameController).
