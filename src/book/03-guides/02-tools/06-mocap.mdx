[Motive](https://optitrack.com/software/motive/) is the software package used to run our OptiTrack motion capture system. This guide explains how to set up and operate the system using **Motive 2.3.1**. It covers prerequisites, network setup, Motive configuration, and calibration.

---

## Prerequisites

<details>

<summary>Hardware</summary>

- **MSI Laptop** (Windows 10, Motive 2.3.1 pre-installed)  
- **Motive License USB dongle** (must be plugged into the MSI laptop for Motive to launch)  
- **Motion capture cameras** (10 units, connected via PoE switch/modem)  
- **Calibration wand**  
- **Calibration square**  
- **Reflective markers**  

</details>

<details>

<summary>Network</summary>

- **Dedicated modem/router** for the motion capture system (isolated network)  
- Ethernet cables for connecting cameras, modem, and laptop  

<Alert type="info">

If Motive does not detect all cameras, confirm that the laptop and cameras are on the isolated network (see next section).  

</Alert>

## Connecting the Isolated Network

> *Note: This step may not need to be repeated every time. If the motion capture network is already configured, skip to the next section.*

1. Connect the **motion capture modem/router** to the ethernet wall ports.  
2. Connect the **MSI laptop** to this modem via ethernet.  
3. At the **main lab modem**, disconnect **[TBD: insert exact cable/port name]** and connect it to **[TBD: insert mocap port/cable]**.  
   - **Important:** Doing this temporarily removes ethernet access from the main lab network. Double-check that no one else is relying on the main network before switching.  
4. Once complete, the motion capture system is on its own isolated network. The MSI laptop and all cameras should now communicate exclusively through this network.

## Configuring Motive

1. Open the **MSI laptop** and boot into **Windows 10**.  
2. Insert the **Motive USB license dongle**.  
3. Launch **Motive 2.3.1** (allow a few seconds for the license to be detected).  
4. In the Motive interface, check the **camera list**. You should see **10 connected cameras**.  
   - If cameras are missing, revisit the **Connecting the Isolated Network** step.  

The initial view of the software should look something like the figure below. You can toggle between camera view vs perspective view via the highlighted red box.

## Camera Calibration

Before recording any datasets, the camera system must be calibrated to ensure accurate tracking.  
- Recalibrate **whenever a camera is moved or bumped**, even slightly.  
- Best practice: **calibrate before every data recording session**, as the process only takes a few minutes.  

1. Clear the capture field of all objects.  
2. In Motive, go to **Camera View**, and click **Mask Visible**.  
   - This masks out static background reflections.  
   - Ensure no reflective markers you intend to use (e.g., calibration wand) are visible before applying the mask.  
3. In Motive, select **all 10 cameras** in the camera pane and click **Start Wanding**.  
   - The 3D viewport will highlight red.  
   - A calibration table will appear, showing the number of samples collected per camera. Aim for roughly equal counts across all cameras.  
4. Power on the **calibration wand** (switch on the back) once you are on the field.  
5. Move the wand smoothly through the capture volume.  
   - Refer to [this tutorial video (at 1:26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZrhw9SoeEI) for demonstration.  
6. Once all cameras have adequate coverage, stop the wanding process by powering off the wand before leaving the field. This ensures that the cameras don't track the wand outside our desired capture volume.  

    <Alert type="info">

    While you are performing the calibration, look at each camera and notice that when it detects the calibration wand, it will begin to glow a green ring around the LEDs. The completeness of this ring indicates how many unique samples the camera has recieved, which is important for calibration. This can be used as an indicator when to stop the calibration.

    </Alert>

7. Click **Calculate** to finalise calibration.  
   - Watch the result message carefully:  
     - Aim for **Exceptional** calibration quality (green status) as shown in the image below.

<Alert type="warning">

If calibration quality is below *Exceptional*, repeat the wanding process with slower and wider coverage.

</Alert>

### Setting The Ground Plane

Following Camera Calibration, you may notice that the 3D view of the cameras within Motive is skewed. This is because the system does not know where to reference our ground plane. To fix this, we must use the calibration square to set our ground plane.

1. Obtain the calibration square and place in the middle of the field, setting the Z direction to face the carpark 8 side of the ES building as shown in the figure below.

    ![Ground Plane](./images/ground_plane.png'Positioning of Calibration Square')


2. In motive, select **Set Ground Plane**. Upon selecting this, you will be prompted to save the calibration file. Ensure that the directory is `Desktop->calibration` and hit save. You should see the 3D view update so that the cameras are now referenced from this plane. 

The calibration process is now complete.
