## NUbots

### Why is `./b target generic` taking so long?

If `./b target generic` (or `./b target nuc...`) is taking more than ~10 minutes and you haven't modified the Dockerfile, then something is wrong. You should see it downloading layers from DockerHub, not building everything from scratch. 

A simple fix is to remove your BuildKit container. 

1. Run `docker container ls`
  You should see an entry like

  ```
  a07fa40e50f2   moby/buildkit:buildx-stable-1   "buildkitd --allow-iâ€¦"   4 days ago   Up 2 hours             buildx_buildkit_nubots0
  ```

  The first entry is the `CONTAINER_ID`. 

2. Run `docker stop <CONTAINER_ID>`, replacing  `<CONTAINER_ID>` with your BuildKit container ID from the previous step.

3. Run `docker rm <CONTAINER_ID>`, replacing  `<CONTAINER_ID>` with your BuildKit container ID.

4. Run `./b target <target>`, where `<target>` is the desired target, such as `generic`. The command should pull from DockerHub now rather than build from scratch. 

Another fix is to reinstall Docker.

1. Completely uninstall everything and delete images, containers, volumes and configuration files. From [Ask Ubuntu Stack Exchange](https://askubuntu.com/questions/935569/how-to-completely-uninstall-docker).

  ```
  sudo apt-get purge -y docker-engine docker docker.io docker-ce docker-ce-cli docker-compose-plugin
  sudo apt-get autoremove -y --purge docker-engine docker docker.io docker-ce docker-compose-plugin
  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker /etc/docker
  sudo rm /etc/apparmor.d/docker
  sudo groupdel docker
  sudo rm -rf /var/run/docker.sock
  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/containerd
  sudo rm -r ~/.docker
  ```

2. Follow the Docker install instructions on [the Getting Started page](https://nubook.nubots.net/guides/main/getting-started#docker).

3. Run `./b target <target>`, where `<target>` is the desired target, such as `generic`. The command should pull from DockerHub now rather than build from scratch. 

If you're still having issues, make sure your local Dockerfile in the `NUbots/NUbots` repository is the same as on [GitHub](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile). You may need to merge main into your branch. If you are making modifications to the Dockerfile, you will have to build the image yourself. Layers are cached, so anything before your modification in the Dockerfile should not rebuild. 

### Why am I having no such file errors?

If your compiler can't find `FileWatcher.h` as in the following error:

```bash
nuclear/roles/firmwareinstaller.cpp:3:10: fatal error: extension/FileWatcher/src/FileWatcher.h: No such file or directory
    3 | #include "extension/FileWatcher/src/FileWatcher.h"
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Run `./b configure --clean`. This refreshes the docker volumes, removing the offending file.

### Why isn't my new file being compiled?

If you have just added a new file to the codebase, make sure that it's part of a role. After you have added it to a role, run `./b configure`, and the build system should detect the new file and compile it the next time you run `./b build`.

### Why am I having CMakeCache errors when I run `./b <command>`?

If you're having errors which say that there was no such value in `b.cmake_cache` such as in this snippet:

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/nubots/NUbots/nuclear/b.py", line 113, in <module>
    module.run(**vars(command.parse_args()))
  File "/home/nubots/NUbots/tools/utility/dockerise/run.py", line 79, in _run
    func(**kwargs)
  File "/home/nubots/NUbots/tools/run.py", line 34, in run
    use_asan = b.cmake_cache["USE_ASAN"] == "ON"
KeyError: 'USE_ASAN'
```

you might have a `CMakeCache.txt` file in your NUbots directory messing up the build's cache.
You can find and delete the file in your text editor, or by running the find command inside the NUbots directory:

```bash
# Make sure that you're in the NUbots project directory before executing this...
find . -type f -name CMakeCache.txt -delete && find . -type d -name CMakeFiles -delete
```

If the problem persists, try purging the build volume by running `./b configure --clean`.
Note that purging the build volume means you'll have to rerun `./b build` to use built code.

### Not enough memory in Docker? (macOS)

By default Docker Desktop will allocate 2GB of memory to use for building images. When building the NUbots image, this is insufficient and will result in an error. To fix this, open the Docker menu in the menu bar, go to advanced settings, and increase the memory available.

## NUsight

### Multiple Docker robots in NUsight?

This means someone else is also running a Docker robot. You can modify the name of your Docker robot by doing the following.

1. Open the `NetworkConfiguration.yaml` file in a text editor (here we are using nano on the command line):

   ```bash
   nano module/support/configuration/NetworkConfiguration/data/config/NetworkConfiguration.yaml
   ```

2. Update the `name` field with the name you want to use and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> to save the file and then <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to exit.

3. Rebuild using `./b build` for the changes to take effect.

4. In NUsight, toggle off the robots you do not want to see by clicking the robot icon at the top right of the NUsight GUI and toggling the slider next to the name of every other robot except the one you set in step 2.

## Hardware

Take care when working with hardware. If you are unsure, ask someone directly for assistance.

## NUbook

<Alert type="info">
  The commands shown below should be run from the NUbook root folder, unless otherwise stated.
</Alert>

### Why is my newly added page not showing up?

When you add a new page, you should remove the Gatsby `.cache` and `public` folders, by running:

```bash
rm -rf .cache public
```

And then try building again:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Why am I getting weird errors when I run `yarn dev`?

Usually this happens when there is a problem with one or more packages in the `node_modules` folder. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `yarn` to reinstall dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules && yarn
```

Then try building again:

```bash
yarn dev
```

### Why am I getting errors from Prettier when running `yarn dev`? / Why can't I push to GitHub?

If a page you have added or changed is not formatted correctly, your changes may not show up in the NUbook preview, and you will not be able to push to GitHub.

To fix this, run:

```bash
yarn format --fix
```

### Why are my changes not showing up in NUbook?

First, make sure you have saved the file, then refresh NUbook in the browser to see if your changes show up.

If you have created a new page or added a new image, you may need to remove the `.cache` and `public` folders. To do so, run:

```bash
rm -rf .cache public
```

And then try building again:

```bash
yarn dev
```
