## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you know the basics of git and basic shell commands.

## Getting Code Into a Repository

Suppose you have a file you have made which you would like to add to a NUbots repository, called `my_file.cpp`, as part of your project to make the robot stand up.

In terminal, change directory to where you have the repo cloned. 

```sh
 cd ~/NUbots/NUbots
```
### Select Branch

If you are working within an existing project, then you need to find out which branch the work is on. To list the branches, use `git branch`. Once you can see which branch you want swap to it:

```sh
git checkout <branch name>
```

If you are not working on an existing project, you need to make a branch to commit your changes to. The format for branch names is `surname/project_name`. So for this example it could be `citizen/stand_up`:

```sh
git branch citizen/stand_up
```

### Making a Pull Request

Once you have a set of commits on your branch which you think should be added to the main codebase, you can make a Pull Request (PR). PRs are where users ask the repository to pull their branch into the `master` branch.

To make a PR, go to https://github.com/NUbots/ and select the repo where your branch is located. tk. Select the branch you are using tk, then click `New pull request` next to that.

Title your PR with a description of the changes that it will make tk. For this example we could use `Add stand-up script`. If you need to give more detail about what the code does, put that as a comment.
Add reviewers to the pull request tk. If you have a project mentor, they should be a reviewer, as well as someone else who knows about that part of the codebase. These people need to approve the code changes before they can be merged in.

Once you have reviewers selected, click the big green `Create pull request` button. The page which is created is where the code review stage will take place.

### Code Review

The reviewers will give constructive feedback about your code, by making comments on code snippets from your changes. You can respond to these on github. They can also directly suggest changes to specific sections. Additional commits you make to the branch will update the PR and will reset their review of changed sections.

Once the reviewers are happy with it, and all of the comments are resolved, you can `Squash and Merge`. Squashing removes detailed commit descriptions, so that `master` is not messy with every commit ever. Once the code has been squashed and merged, it is in the codebase and you have succeeded in contributing code to NUbots.

## Commit Etiquette

Commits should make minor changes, and the changes in each commit should have a common theme. A general mantra for contributing code is `commit often, push once`. Committing often means that the code is built up incrementally. Pushing once means that you don't spam all the other contributors with notifications.

## Formatting and buildkite

Before making a pull request, it is important that your code adheres to the formatting rules. For branches in the NUbots repo, running `./b format` before your last commit should fix formatting issues. Code in the NUbook repo must be formatted with `yarn format` before it can be committed.

If your code is in a different and it uses C++ or protobuf files, use the `.clang-format` file in the NUbots repo to format them.

If you get a message that your build failed, try running the relevant format commands and then committing the changes which they made. You won't be able to merge the PR until the build checks pass.
