This page aims to provide direction and resources on where to go to learn more about various areas of NUbots. There is a mixture of resources available, including external resources and material prepared by NUbots team members. The main resources are Reading pages, videos and workshops. Workshops are run in lab, or on Zoom when not possible to do in the lab, by a member of the team. LinkedIn Learning has many great videos, some of which are linked here - as a UoN student, you can get access to LinkedIn Learning for free.

## General

### Git

The NUbots team uses Git and GitHub in its development workflow. Almost any project done on the NUbots team will involve using Git and GitHub.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: Git and PR Workflow](/guides/general/git)

**Videos:**

- LinkedIn Learning: Git Concepts
- LinkedIn Learning: Git Command Line
- LinkedIn Learning: GitKraken
- LinkedIn Learning: GitHub Desktop

**Tutorials:**

- NUbots runs [a workshop on Git and the PR workflow](https://github.com/NUbots/GitDemos).

### NUClear

The NUbots robot code uses the NUClear framework. Anyone developing robot code needs to learn how to work with NUClear.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: NUClear](/system/foundations/nuclear)

**Videos:**

- [YouTube: NUClear Basic Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4yU-eA6bk&t=17m00s)
- [YouTube: NUClear Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4yU-eA6bk&t=32m00s)

**Tutorials:**

- A NUClear workshop will be created and run in the future, likely based on the NUClear example in the video above.

### C++

The C++ programming language is used in the main robot codebase. Modern C++ and advanced C++ concepts are used in the codebase.

**Videos:**

- [LinkedIn Learning: C++ Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-essential-training) - For student who have not completed [SENG1120](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/SENG1120), or need a refresher.
- [LinkedIn Learning: C++ Advanced Topics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-advanced-topics?u=75842122)

**Tutorials:**

- NUbots runs [a workshop on modern C++](https://github.com/NUbots/NULearning/blob/master/cpp/moderncpp.md).

### Lab Induction

The lab induction must be completed before getting swipe card access to the lab.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: Lab Induction](/team/induction)

**Tutorials:**

- NUbots lab inductions are run for new team members after they join.

### Using Webots

The Webots simulator is used in some RoboCup competitions and is the simulator we use to aid in development of the robots.

**Reading:**

- [Setting up Webots](/guides/tools/webots-setup)

### Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is important for many robotics systems. In the main robot codebase, the [Eigen C++ linear algebra library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/) is used.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: Mathematics](/system/foundations/mathematics#linear-algebra)

### Log and Play Back Data

**Reading:**

- [Data Recording and Playback Guide](/guides/main/data-recording-playback)
- [Logging](/system/subsystems/logging)

### Python

Python is used in the build system in the main robot codebase.

**Videos:**

- [LinkedIn Learning: Python Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/)

### RoboCup Competition

**Reading:**

- [RoboCup Humanoid League: Rules of the Game](https://humanoid.robocup.org/materials/rules/)

**Videos:**

- [YouTube: Referee Training Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHOtAklrcJU)

## DevOps and Quality Assurance

### The Build System

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: Build System](https://nubook.nubots.net/system/foundations/build-system)

### Docker

**Reading:**

- [Book: Docker Deep Dive](https://www.amazon.com.au/Docker-Deep-Dive-Nigel-Poulton-ebook/dp/B01LXWQUFF)

## DevTools

### Web Development

Web Development is used in the creation of [NUbook](/system/tools/nubook), which uses JavaScript and Gatsby, and [NUsight](/system/tools/nusight), which uses TypeScript and React.

**Videos:**

- [egghead.io: MobX](https://egghead.io/courses/manage-complex-state-in-react-apps-with-mobx)

**Tutorials:**

- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
- [egghead.io: A Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)

**Mixed:**

- [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript Resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Official TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/)
- [Official React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Official MobX Documentation](https://mobx.js.org/README.html)

### Documentation

Since NUbots is a student organisation, high turnover is unavoidable. To help combat the issues this creates, good documentation is key to the success of the team. This includes low level documentation in the form of code comments and high level documentation in the form of NUbook pages.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: NUbook](/system/tools/nubook)
- [Australian Network on Disability: A Beginner's Guide to Accessible Content](https://www.and.org.au/pages/a-beginners-guide-to-accessible-content.html)

**Tutorials:**

- [Google Technical Writing Course](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) - free, in-class sessions are open to the public!
