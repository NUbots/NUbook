This page aims to provide direction and resources on where to go to learn more about various areas of NUbots. There is a mixture of resources available, including external resources and material prepared by NUbots team members. The main resources are Reading pages, videos and workshops. Workshops are run in lab, or on Zoom when not possible to do in the lab, by a member of the team. LinkedIn Learning has many great videos, some of which are linked here - as a UoN student, you can get access to LinkedIn Learning for free.

## General

### Git

The NUbots team uses Git and GitHub in its development workflow. Almost any project done on the NUbots team will involve using Git and GitHub.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: Git and PR Workflow](/guides/general/git)

**Videos:**

- LinkedIn Learning: Git Concepts
- LinkedIn Learning: Git Command Line
- LinkedIn Learning: GitKraken
- LinkedIn Learning: GitHub Desktop

**Workshops:**

- NUbots runs a workshop on Git and the PR workflow. You can find [the workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/NUbots/GitDemos).

### NUClear

The NUbots robot code uses the NUClear framework. Anyone developing robot code needs to learn how to work with NUClear.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: NUClear](/system/foundations/nuclear)

**Videos:**

- [YouTube: NUClear Basic Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4yU-eA6bk&t=17m00s)
- [YouTube: NUClear Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx4yU-eA6bk&t=32m00s)

**Workshops:**

A NUClear workshop will be created and run in the future, likely based on the NUClear example in the video above.

### C++

The C++ programming language is used in the main robot codebase. Modern C++ and advanced C++ concepts are used in the codebase.

**Videos:**

- [LinkedIn Learning: C++ Basics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-essential-training) - For student who have not completed [SENG1120](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/SENG1120), or need a refresher.
- [LinkedIn Learning: C++ Advanced Topics](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/c-plus-plus-advanced-topics?u=75842122)

**Workshops:**

- NUbots runs a workshop on modern C++. You can find [the workshop on GitHub](https://github.com/NUbots/NULearning/blob/master/cpp/moderncpp.md).

### Lab Induction

The lab induction must be completed before getting swipe card access to the lab.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: Lab Induction](/team/induction)

**Workshop:**

- NUbots lab inductions are run for new team members after they join.

### Using Webots

The Webots simulator is used in some RoboCup competitions and is the simulator we use to aid in development of the robots.

**Reading:**

- [Setting up Webots](/guides/tools/webots-setup)

### Linear Algebra

Linear Algebra is important for many robotics systems. In the main robot codebase, the [Eigen C++ linear algebra library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/) is used.

**Reading:**

- [NUbook: Mathematics](/system/foundations/mathematics#linear-algebra)

### Log and Play Back Data

**Reading:**

- [Data Recording and Playback Guide](/guides/main/data-recording-playback)
- [Logging](/system/subsystems/logging)

### Python

Python is used in the build system in the main robot codebase.

**Videos:**

- [LinkedIn Learning: Python Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-essential-training-2/)

### RoboCup Competition

**Reading:**

- [RoboCup Humanoid League: Rules of the Game](https://humanoid.robocup.org/materials/rules/)

**Videos:**

- [YouTube: Referee Training Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHOtAklrcJU)
