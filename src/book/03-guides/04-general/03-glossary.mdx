## Conventions and Notations

**For naming conventions of matrices and vectors see the [Mathematics Section](/system/foundations/mathematics).**

**Coordinate Orientation**: Robot's local coordinate system is x forward, y to the left, z up. Global coordinates are also z up.

**Roll, Pitch, Yaw**: When Roll, Pitch and Yaw are in space and otherwise undefined, they are defined as a right hand rule around the x, y, z axes respectively.

**Spherical Coordinates**: 3-Dimensional vectors in spherical coordinates are $(\rho, \theta, \phi )$, where $\rho$ is the radial distance, $\theta$ is the polar angle, and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle.
