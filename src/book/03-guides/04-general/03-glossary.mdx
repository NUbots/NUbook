## Internal

**NUbook:** The NUbots documentation website. Available at https://nubook.nubots.net
**NUClear:** The software framework which the NUbots codebase is built on. Put simply, it works by triggering callbacks when events occur. https://nuclear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
    **Powerplant:** The central message system which connects the reactors.
    **Reactor:** A NUClear module. Modules in the NUbots codebase are reactors. tk add links to the docs
    **Reaction:** The callbacks which need to run when an event or conditions indicate as such. These manifest as DSL **on tk linkhttps://nuclear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dsl.html#on-statements** statements.
**NBS (NUClear Binary Stream):**
**NUfsr:** A system designed to detect if a NUgus' foot is on the ground
**NUgus:** NUbots robots as used in the RoboCup humanoid league.
**NUsight:** NUbots' visualisation software, ran through the browser. Source is available at https://github.com/NUbots/NUsight  
**NUsense:** A secret project for sensor IO.
**Old Walk Engine:** A previously used walk engine, originally optimised with Gazebo (tk link)
**quintic walk:** 
**scripttuner:**
**scriptrunner:**
**Utilities:** Code which is meant for use across multiple modules, with more general applications. Usually in the **utility** namespace.
**visualmesh:** A computer vision technique NUbots uses which overlays a mesh over the image input to more efficiently sample it and look for objects.

## General

**affine:**
**container:** An isolated environment which decouples the environment an application runs in from the environment it's developed in.
**continuous integration:** A development practice whereby frequent updates to a codebase from multiple developers are integrated and automated.
**euler angles:**
    **roll:**
    **pitch:**
    **yaw:**
**IMU:**
**inverse-kinematics:**
**kalman filter:**
**kinematics:** Mathematics which describes motion, which is used to calculate trajectories and servo outputs to control robots.
**lambda expression:** A way of defining an anonymous function in C++.
**mahony filter:**
**mocap:**
**Transform:** A matrix representation of a transformation
**Transformation:** A spatial manipulation - often representated as a translation and a rotation.

## External

**arch:** A lightweight linux distribution which the NUgus robots use as their primary operating system.
**bitbots:**
**Armadillo (arma):** The C++ linear algebra library developed by the CSIRO NUbots used to use.
**Buildkite:** A platform for running fast, secure, and scalable continuous integration pipelines, which NUbots runs on machines in the NUbots lab.
**clang:** A compiler, frontend, and tooling infrastructure used for C and C++ which is part of the LLVM infrastructure.
**clang-format:** A software which formats source code according to a given set of rules.
**cm740?:**
**Cmake**
**darwin:**
**docker:** A software service for developing containers which enable standardised cross-platform development consistency.
**dockerhub:** A hosting service for docker images.
**igus:** 
**Eigen:** The C++ linear algebra library NUbots uses.
**gazebo:** A simulation software used which was used to optimise the "OldWalkEngine" with a genetic algorithm.
**Git:** A version control program used by NUbots.
**GitHub:** A source code hosting service, which uses a git backend. NUbots uses GitHub to manage the source code.
**LLVM:** A set of modular compiler and toolchain technologies.
**nuc:** Intel's portable computing platform which is used in the NUgus robots.
**opencl:** Open Computing Language is a framework NUbots uses to create programs which can run on graphics hardware.
**Protobuf:** Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a method of serializing structured data, created by Google. Protobuf messages are the means of passing messages between NUClear reactors.
**robahn:**
**robocup:**
**robocup symposium:**
**simulink:**
**yaml:**
