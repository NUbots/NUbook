### Why am I having no such file errors?

If your compiler can't find `FileWatcher.h` as in the following error:

```sh
nuclear/roles/firmwareinstaller.cpp:3:10: fatal error: extension/FileWatcher/src/FileWatcher.h: No such file or directory
    3 | #include "extension/FileWatcher/src/FileWatcher.h"
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

Run `./b configure --clean`. This refreshes the docker volumes, removing the offending file.

### Why isn't my new file being compiled?

If you have just added a new file to the codebase, make sure that it's part of a role. After you have added it to a role, run `./b configure`, and the build system should detect the new file and compile it the next time you run `./b build`.

### Why am I having CMakeCache errors when I do `./b run <role>`?

If you're having errors which say that there was no such value in `b.cmake_cache` such as in this snippet, you'll need to delete your `CMakeCache.txt` file, which forces it to be remade.

```py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/nubots/NUbots/nuclear/b.py", line 113, in <module>
    module.run(**vars(command.parse_args()))
  File "/home/nubots/NUbots/tools/utility/dockerise/run.py", line 79, in _run
    func(**kwargs)
  File "/home/nubots/NUbots/tools/run.py", line 34, in run
    use_asan = b.cmake_cache["USE_ASAN"] == "ON"
KeyError: 'USE_ASAN'
```

To delete the `CMakeCache.txt` file, you'll have to go into the docker container, and delete the file manually. To do this, run the following commands in the NUbots folder

```sh
./b shell
rm /home/nubots/build/CMakeCache.txt
exit
```

Now, you'll have to run `./b build`, which should automatically configure and recreate that cache properly.

### Why is my newly added page not showing up?

When you add a new page, you should remove the Gatsby `.cache` and `public` folders, by running:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public
```

And then try building again:

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Why am I getting weird errors when I run `yarn dev`?

Usually this happens when there is a problem with one or more packages in the `node_modules` folder. Try deleting `node_modules` and running `yarn` to reinstall dependencies:

```sh
rm -rf node_modules && yarn
```

Then try building again:

```sh
yarn dev
```

### Why am I getting errors from Prettier when running `yarn dev`? / Why can't I push to GitHub?

If a page you have added or changed is not formatted correctly, your changes may not show up in the NUbook preview, and you will not be able to push to GitHub.

To fix this, run:

```sh
yarn format --fix
```

### Why are my changes not showing up in NUbook?

First, make sure you have saved the file, then refresh NUbook in the browser to see if your changes show up.

If you have created a new page or added a new image, you may need to remove the `.cache` and `public` folders. To do so, run:

```sh
rm -rf .cache public
```

And then try building again:

```sh
yarn dev
```
