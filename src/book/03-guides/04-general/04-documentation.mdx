## Conventions

We use the [Javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) documentation style. This means we use tokens called "directives" or "tags" to annotate different parts of a comment with rich metadata. These directives start with `@` or `\\` (`@` is preferred) and are followed by the directive name, arguments (for some directives), and a single line of description.

When writing modules, the `.hpp` should include a documenting comment for each class, struct, function, method, global variable, member variable and anything extra that you think may need one.

### Directives

These are the common directives:

| `@brief` | A brief description of the following code. Every documenting comment should have this. If the first line does not have a directive it is treated as `@brief`.|
| `@details` | All the details that someone using this thing might need to know beyond what is provided in other directives. Comment lines after the initial one but before any directive are treated as `@details`.|
| `@param[direction] <formal name>` | Details a parameter that is passed to a function. Direction is either `in` or `out` and is usually omitted.|
| `@return` | Details what a function returns.|
| `@retval <value>` | Details specific return value meanings, usually for enums, booleans or error codes.|
| `@throws <type name>` | Details what a function throws.|
| `@tparam <formal name>` | Details a template parameter, usually a [named requirement](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req) or other requirements that must be fulfilled.|
| `@author` | The author and maintainer of this code. Git blame is unreliable as some changes could just be formatting.|

This is a list of less common directives that may be used, see the [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmd_intro) documentation for the full list.

| `@example <file-name>` | Indicates that an example of how the function or class should be used is at `<file-name>`.|
| `@see <name>` | Links to the documentation for another class, function or variable.|
| `@attention` | Tells the reader that they should pay attention to the following point.|
| `@warning` | Tells the reader something that may go wrong, and ways of avoiding such a fate.|
| `@note` | Extra information that does not fit in other tags.|
| `@remark` | An aside or candid comment about the code or approach.|
| `@todo` | Adds a todo to the documentation. |
| `@post` | Details a post condition. |
| `@pre` | Details a pre condition. |
| `@code{.<language>}` and `@endcode` | starts and finishes a code block respectively, similar to \` in NUbook. `{.language}` is optional.|
| `@copydoc <name>` | Copies the documentation from another thing.|
| `@f$`, `@f[`, `@f]`, `@f{<environment>}{` and `@f}` | Creates (latex)[https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematics] (doxygen formulas)[https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/formulas.html].|
| `@verbatim` and `@endverbatim` | Starts and finishes verbatim output respectively, which outputs exactly what you write.|

### Extra formatting

HTML can be used, but should be kept to simple tags like `<b>` and `<em>`. See the (official documentation)[https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/htmlcmds.html] for a full list of available HTML tags.

### Example

This example shows more than we normally require, but tries to give an example of how most directives can be used.

```c++
/**
 * @brief Is super cool.
 * @detail Is cooler than all the other classes. It graduated from the university of cool.
 * @tparam T The first template argument
 * @tparam U The second template arguemnt
 */
template <typename T, typename U>
class CoolClass {
    /// @brief Holds the meaning of life the universe and everything
    private int douglas = 42;

    /// @copydoc douglas
    private int ryan = 42;

    /**
     * @brief Calculates if this class is cool
     * @detail Checks against the university of cool records to see if this class graduated.
     * @param year The year that class graduated.
     * @throws NotFoundError The class was not found in the university of cool records.
     * @return Whether or not the class is cool.
     * @retval true The class is cool.
     * @retval false The class is not cool.
     */
    [[nodiscard]] bool is_cool(const int& year) const;
};

/**
 * @brief Prints the if CoolClass is cool or not.
 * @see CoolClass::is_cool
 */
void print_cool();
```

## Future

In the future we are planning to use a combination of Doxygen and our NUClear mapper for automatic low level documentation of our code, which will be included in NUbook.
