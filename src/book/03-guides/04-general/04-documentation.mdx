## Conventions

We use the javadoc documentation style for comments that are able to be formatted with doxygen. Each variable, function and class declaration should have a comment detailing the information about it in the `.hpp` file.

### Directives

This is a list of directives that we use.

- `@brief` A brief description of the following code. Everything should at least have this tag.
- `@detail` A complete and detailed description of the code.
- `@param` Details a paramter that is passed to a function.
- `@return` Details what a function returns.
- `@retval` Details specific return value meanings, usually for enums, booleans or error codes.
- `@throws` Details on what a function throws.
- `@tparam` Details on the template parameter, usually a [named requirement](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req) or other requirements that must be fulfilled.

This is a list of extra things that may be used, see [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/commands.html#cmd_intro) documentation for the full list.

- `@example <file-name>` An example of how the function or class should be used is at `<file-name>`.
- `@see` Tells the reader to read documentation for another class, function or variable.
- `@attention` Tells the reader that they must pay attention.
- `@warning` Tells the reader something that may go wrong.
- `@note` Tells the reader to take note.
- `@remark` A remark about the thing.
- `@todo` Adds a todo to the documentation.
- `@post` Details a post condition.
- `@pre` Details a pre condition.
- `@code` and `@endcode` starts and finishes a code block, like \` and in NUbook.
- `@copydoc` Copies the documentation from another thing.
- `@dot` and `@enddot` Creates a dot graph.
- `@msc` and `@endmsc` Creates a [mscgen](https://www.mcternan.me.uk/mscgen/) diagram.
- `@startuml` and `@enduml` Creates a [uml](https://plantuml.com/) diagram.
- `@f$`, `@f[`, `@f]`, `@f{<environment>}{` and `@f}` Creates latex mathematics.
- `@verbatim` and `@endverbatim` Starts and finishes verbatim output.
- `@author` The author of this code, this is not used often in NUbots as we generally rely on the git blame instead.

Basic html can be used, like `<b>` and `<em>`.

### Example

This example is more than normally required, but tries to give an example of how most directives work.

```c++
/**
 * @brief Is super cool.
 * @detail Is cooler than all the other classes. It graduated from the university of cool.
 * @tparam T The first template argument
 * @tparam U The second template arguemnt
 */
template <typename T, typename U>
class Cool_Class {
    /// @brief Holds the meaning of life the universe and everything
    private int a = 42;

    /**
     * @brief Calculates if this class is cool
     * @detail Checks against the university of cool records to see if this class graduated.
     * @param year The year that class graduated.
     * @throws NotFoundError The class was not found in the university of cool records.
     * @return Whether or not the class is cool.
     * @retval true The class is cool.
     * @retval flase The class is not cool.
     */
    bool is_cool(const int& year) const;
};
```

## Future

In the future we are planning to use a combination of doxygen and our documentation generator for automatic low level documentation for NUbook.
