The onboarding task aims to teach new members about [NUClear](https://nuclear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). New members will be asked to engage in coding with C++. Prerequisites such as Git, VS code, etc. must be set up first before moving forward with this task. See [NUbook: Getting Started](https://nubook.nubots.net/guides/main/getting-started#page-content) for more details.

## Terminologies

### Role

A **Role** is a file that defines the desired purpose or functionality of the binary/program we want to compile. A role file lists what modules we want included in our program/binary. An example of a role:

```cpp
nuclear_role(
  extension::FileWatcher
  support::logging::ConsoleLogHandler
  actuation::KinematicsConfiguration
  platform::${SUBCONTROLLER}::HardwareIO
  input::SensorFilter
  extension::Director
  actuation::Kinematics
  actuation::Servos
  onboarding::Ping
  onboarding::Pong
  onboarding::Judge
)
```

### Messages

A message is called a neutron. It is essentially a `.proto` file. When a role is built, the proto file becomes imported as a .hpp file. For example, The Ping.proto file looks like:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package message.onboarding;

message Ping {
    int32 val = 1;
    int32 iter_count = 2;
}
```

It should be imported as `#include "message/onboarding/Ping.hpp"`. This message can hold a 32-bit integer variable named `val` and `iter_count`. All messages are stored in folder `shared/message`.

### Modules

**Modules** respond to and send information into the system using **messages**. They use the `emit()` function to send messages and `on<<DSL> message>()` functions to respond to them. Consider the following example `Ping` module:

```cpp
#include "Ping.hpp"

#include "extension/Configuration.hpp"

#include "message/onboarding/Ping.hpp"
#include "message/onboarding/Pong.hpp"

namespace module::onboarding {

    using extension::Configuration;

    Ping::Ping(std::unique_ptr<NUClear::Environment> environment) : Reactor(std::move(environment)) {

        using message::onboarding::Ping;
        using message::onboarding::Pong;

        on<Configuration>("Ping.yaml").then([this](const Configuration& config) {
            // Use configuration here from file Ping.yaml
            this->log_level = config["log_level"].as<NUClear::LogLevel>();
        });

        on<Trigger<Pong>>().then([this](const Pong& pong_msg) {
            auto ping_msg = std::make_unique<Ping>();
            log<NUClear::INFO>("Ping");
            emit(ping_msg);
        });
    }

}  // namespace module::onboarding
```

Let's dive into what's going on within this module:

At the top of a module, we include the necessary header and message files:

```cpp
#include "Ping.hpp"

#include "extension/Configuration.hpp"

#include "message/onboarding/Ping.hpp"
#include "message/onboarding/Pong.hpp"
```

Next, the module is defined as a class that inherits from the NUClear environment. It is essentially the module itself:

```cpp
namespace module::onboarding {

    using extension::Configuration;

    Ping::Ping(std::unique_ptr<NUClear::Environment> environment) : Reactor(std::move(environment)) {

        using message::onboarding::Ping;
        using message::onboarding::Pong;
```

Within the Pong module are the `on` functions that were mentioned earlier:

```cpp
        on<Configuration>("Ping.yaml").then([this](const Configuration& config) {
            // Use configuration here from file Ping.yaml
            this->log_level = config["log_level"].as<NUClear::LogLevel>();
        });

        on<Startup>().then([this] {
            // Vibe
        });

        on<Trigger<Pong>>().then([this](const Pong& pong_msg) {
            auto ping_msg = std::make_unique<Ping>();
            log<NUClear::INFO>("Ping");
            emit(ping_msg);
        });
```

- `on<Configuration>` is used to load in configuration values from file `Pong.yaml`
- `on<Startup>()` runs just once when the module starts
- `on<Trigger<Ping>>()` runs when `Ping` message is received and prints "Ping"

<Alert type='info'>

The `log<NUClear::INFO>("Ping");` can be thought of as the equivalent of an `std::cout` in normal C++ or a `print` in python. There are various types that can be used for logging information. See NUbook for more information.

</Alert>

## Task: Git Branching

Open a terminal and checkout the branch `montano/onboarding` by running the following:

```bash
git checkout montano/onboarding
```

This branch has a role `onboarding.role` and module `Ping` already created for you.

Now, we will create our own branch which extends from this:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-last-name>/branching-task
```

This is your own workspace where you can make changes and implement new features.

<Alert type='info'>

Don't be afraid to break things in your own branch! It will not directly impact the `main` branch.

</Alert>

### VSCode Git Extension

There exists many GUI tools for using Git which can make your life easier, for example VSCode, Github Desktop or Git Kraken.

In VScode, you can create your own branch by clicking on the button on the bottom left hand side, which is the name of the branch that you are currently on. If you have correctly done the git checkout command, then you should be in the `montano/onboarding` branch. Select "Create new branch from" and enter `montano/onboarding`. Enter a branch name which should follow convention `<your-last-name>/<branch-name>`, where branch name should be something clear and simple.

## Task: Creating messages and modules

You should see the `Ping` module already implemented in `NUbots/module/onboarding`.

Currently, this code **will not compile** because a `Pong` message doesn't exist, so let's create it.

Navigate to `NUbots/shared/message/onboarding`, duplicate `Ping.proto` and rename it and its contents to `Pong`. You should have a new file `Pong.proto` in folder `NUbots/shared/message/onboarding` with contents:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package message.onboarding;

message Pong{
}
```

Ensure that the code now compiles by running:

```bash
./b configure --clean
./b build
```

We will now create the `Pong` module which sends out a `Pong` message. Run the following script to generate a template module:

```bash
./b module generate onboarding/Pong
```

Navigate to `NUbots/module/onboarding/Pong` and populate the `Pong.cpp` file with the following code and implement the TODO's:

```cpp
#include "Pong.hpp"

#include "extension/Configuration.hpp"

#include "message/onboarding/Ping.hpp"
#include "message/onboarding/Pong.hpp"

namespace module::onboarding {

    using extension::Configuration;

    Pong::Pong(std::unique_ptr<NUClear::Environment> environment) : Reactor(std::move(environment)) {

        using message::onboarding::Ping;
        using message::onboarding::Pong;

        on<Configuration>("Pong.yaml").then([this](const Configuration& config) {
            // Use configuration here from file Pong.yaml
            this->log_level = config["log_level"].as<NUClear::LogLevel>();
        });

        on<Startup>().then([this] {
            // Start the ping pong chain
            auto pong_msg = std::make_unique<Pong>();
            emit(pong_msg);
        });

        on<Trigger<Ping>>().then([this](const Ping& ping_msg) {
            // TODO: Log a INFO level message with the text "Pong"

            // TODO: Emit a Pong message
        });
    }

}  // namespace module::onboarding
```

Now we need to add this module to the role file `onboarding.role` located in folder `NUbots/roles/test`. It's contents should then look like:

```cpp
nuclear_role(
  # FileWatcher, ConsoleLogHandler and Signal Catcher Must Go First. KinematicsConfiguration usually goes after these
  # and without it many roles do not run
  extension::FileWatcher
  # support::SignalCatcher
  support::logging::ConsoleLogHandler
  # This must come first as it emits config which many roles depend on (e.g. SensorFilter, WalkEngine)
  actuation::KinematicsConfiguration
  platform::${SUBCONTROLLER}::HardwareIO
  input::SensorFilter
  extension::Director
  actuation::Kinematics
  actuation::Servos
  onboarding::Ping
  onboarding::Pong
)
```

Compile and run the program by running the following:

```bash
./b configure
./b build
./b run test/onboarding
```

Once the code is compiling and you are happy with it, commit and push your changes to the cloud:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add pong module"
git push
```

<Alert type='warn'>

Reactors are started in the order that is stated in the role file. Suppose that the startup function within Ping contains the initial emit message but it goes before Pong in the role document, the initial message can be emitted before the reactor Pong is initialised.

</Alert>

## Task: Add property to a message

At this point, we have a `Ping` and `Pong` module and their corresponding messages which communicate with one another, however the messages lack any information. Let's update the `Ping` message following the template below:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package message.onboarding;

message Ping{
    // TODO: Fill this message with an int32 field named "count". What should its tag be?
    // HINT: Look at the format of other proto messages in the code base for reference.
}
```

<Alert type='info'>

Protocol Buffers (protobuf) is a sophisticated library for serialisation, deserialisation and compression of information. We cannot discuss its entirety here but do note that we treat protobufs as data that gets passed around in the system during run time.

</Alert>

Now, within the `Ping` module, increment the counter every time a `Pong` message is received. Emit this message with the incremented value and display this value using a `log` command within the `Pong` module. Below is a template of how you might structure the `Ping` module:

```cpp
#include "Ping.hpp"

#include "extension/Configuration.hpp"

#include "message/onboarding/Ping.hpp"
#include "message/onboarding/Pong.hpp"

namespace module::onboarding {

    using extension::Configuration;

    Ping::Ping(std::unique_ptr<NUClear::Environment> environment) : Reactor(std::move(environment)) {

        using message::onboarding::Ping;
        using message::onboarding::Pong;

        on<Configuration>("Ping.yaml").then([this](const Configuration& config) {
            // Use configuration here from file Ping.yaml
            this->log_level = config["log_level"].as<NUClear::LogLevel>();
        });

        on<Trigger<Pong>>().then([this](const Pong& pong_msg) {
            auto ping_msg = std::make_unique<Ping>();
            ping->count = ????; // TODO: Assign counter value.
            log<NUClear::INFO>("Ping");
            emit(ping_msg);
        });
    }

}  // namespace module::onboarding
```

## Task: Create a pull request

This section contains information about how to open a pull request. First, create your branch and name it. It should be in the format of `author(s)/this-code-does-this`. It is ideal to keep it intuitive and simple. Run `git checkout montano/onboarding` to push to this branch before doing anything else. Follow the images below to create a pull request that pushes to the `montano/onboarding` branch in `NUbots/NUbots`.

Checkout to the branch that you have created (the one created from `montano/onboarding`. Once in the branch, click the cloud with an arrow pointing up on the bottom left hand side of VS code. If you hover over it, you should be able to see "Publish Branch". Click this and navigate to your Github account using your preferred browser. Go to the `NUbots/NUbots` repository. If you were not able to publish your branch successfully, then your write access will need to be given to you by an admin (usually the team leader).

![Publish Branch](images/onboarding_task/pull_request/publish.png)

The "Compare and Pull request" tab should be visible after successful publishing.

![Compare and Pull Request](images/onboarding_task/pull_request/cpr.png)

After clicking on the "Compare and Pull request" button, the image below will follow. Make sure to assign a proper name to your pull request. They should be informative and describe exactly what the code aims to do. Add a description to provide more detailed information about the feature. You may assign people to review your code. When contributing to the code base, it is usually ideal to assign your mentors or the team leaders to review your code. Press the "Create Pull request" when ready. This pull request should now be visible in the pull requests tab in github if done successfully.

![Create Pull Request](images/onboarding_task/pull_request/fcpr.png)

When committing more changes such as new code or new files, navigate to the source control tab, hover over the files that you would like to commit the changes of, then click the `+` button to stage the changes. After adding all the desired changes, make sure to add an informative commit name and press the Commit button.

## Main task

For this task, we aim to evaluate the expression:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^{n} k
$$

where n is the number of iterations, and define it as $n:=10$. Note that evaluating this expression is trivial, as one can implement the shortcut by using $n(n+1)/2$ or using an iterative algorithm instead. As such, we will be introducing requirements and constraints.

**Requirements**

- The code must be written in C++, using NUClear.
- The code must be compiled and installed into a robot.
- Once the right answer has been derived, one must emit that answer. If the correct answer was emitted, the robot should nod yes.
- Members must use at least 3 modules to implement their solutions.
- Members must make their own branch from the fork and submit their code as a pull request for review once finished.

**Constraints**

- Members cannot use a `for` loop or a `while` loop to evaluate the expression.
- Members cannot use the proposed $n(n+1)/2$ shortcut to evaluate the expression
- Only `on<Trigger<...>>` and `emit()` statements can be used.

**Recommendations**

- Use `./b module generate <absolute module path and name>` to generate your modules. A full path example could be something like `test/onboarding_task`.
- They say that naming things is one of the hardest tasks in software engineering. What should the names of your modules be? Should they still be Ping and Pong? Can you think of more suitable names? What about your the names of your messages, i.e., your .proto files?
- NUbook will have all the information you need, and then some. This task cannot explain NUClear in its full glory, but it should be enough to enable members to contribute to the code base as soon as possible. If you wish to know more, you must learn to read documentation and if you are still stuck, don't hesitate to ask questions.
- When in VS code, press `Ctrl + shift + f` to find code snippets. This is particularly useful if members want to know how a specific bit of code should be used or how it is implemented. This will be specifically useful when looking at where to put your files in. For example, proto messages should lie in `~/NUbots-onboarding/shared/messages/...` and modules should lie within `~/NUbots-onboarding/modules`.
- Why at least 3 modules? One will start the reaction, one will determine when to stop sending the message to the other reactor and start emitting the final answer, and one will process the final answer and send the NodYes command. Decoupling is very important for code reliability and robustness. Decouple code should also be very easy to read and review.
- The nuclear role mentioned above will be the role for this task.

Once the code writing activity is finished, ask your supervisor for assistance in flashing the robot with your compiled binaries. This will require a `./b install <nugus id>` followed by `ssh nubots@10.1.1.<nugus id>` and then running the binary by entering `./test/onboarding`.
