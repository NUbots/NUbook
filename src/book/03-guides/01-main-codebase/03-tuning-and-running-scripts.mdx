Scripts are static motions for the robot. By static, we mean they are preconfigured motions that won't change at runtime. They specify what joint angles to move to and how long the robot should take to go to those joint angles. For example, standing up is a small script telling the robot to move its joints to the stand position over one second. There can be many of these position specifications in a row to make the robot do more complex movements like getting up or kicking.

Scripts are run using the script utility and the [Director system](/system/foundations/director). The script utility will convert a specified script yaml file into a [Sequence Task message](/system/subsystems/motion#actuation). It takes each joint position and time from the `.yaml` file and adds these frames to the Sequence of servo targets. The Sequence Provider will request a Director Task for each Group in its Sequence, and will only progress to the next Group when the previous has completed.

More information on the script system is on the [Motion](/system/subsystems/motion#scripts) page. Information on Script Runner and Script Tuner is on the [Behaviour](/system/subsystems/behaviour#script-runner) page.

## Script Runner

The `scriptrunner` command will run a script. It is used as follows:

```bash
./scriptrunner <script_name>
```

Where `<script_name>` is the name of the script you want to run, such as `Stand.yaml`. All scripts can be found in the NUbots repository under `/shared/utility/skill/scripts`.

The script you are running needs to be on the robot in the `/scripts/` folder. These scripts can be robot specific. For example, you could have a stand script specifically for the NUgus 1 robot stored in `/scripts/nugus1/Stand.yaml`. When you run `./scriptrunner Stand.yaml` on NUgus 1, the ScriptEngine will first look for the robot-specific `Stand.yaml` in the `/scripts/nugus1/` folder. If found, it will execute it. If not, it will look for a platform-specific `Stand.yaml` in the `/scripts/nugus/` folder, which it will execute if found. Otherwise, it will look for a more general `Stand.yaml` in the `/scripts/` folder.

More on the script system can be found on the [Configuration and Script System page](/system/foundations/config-script).

## Script Tuner

Script tuner is a tool that can be used to create and modify scripts. To use script tuner, run:

```bash
./scripttuner <script_path>
```

`<script_path>` is the path to the script you want to tune, such as `scripts/nugus/Stand.yaml`. The path can be to an existing script, if you want to edit it, or to a script that does not exist yet if you want to create a new script.

Running a command like the above will open the following interface, which will enable you to tune the script:

```

The first line shows the name and path of the script you are creating or editing.

The second line specifies the number of frames and the current frame, which is highlighted. Each frame specifies different joint (i.e. servo) positions, and when these frames are combined they result in a motion.

The next line is the duration. This determines how long the robot will take to move to the servo positions you have specified. This is measured in milliseconds.

The next section is a table that shows the angle and gain for each servo for that frame.

The bottom of the interface shows what commands are available. It does not show all the commands. All commands can be viewed by typing `:help` and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Note that the letters should be pressed in UPPERCASE.

## Modifying and Adding Scripts

When installing NUbots code onto a robot for tuning scripts, ensure you are using [the correct flag for installing configuration files](/system/foundations/build-system#install), depending on whether you want to overwrite existing scripts on the robot, or not. Ensure that you have enabled the `scripttuner` and `scriptrunner` binaries by turning `scripttuner.role` and `scriptrunner.role` `ON` in `./b configure -i`, before building and installing.

Use script tuner as detailed above to make or edit your script. It is a good idea to have one person using script tuner and another person holding the robot and moving the joints to new positions. Wait a few seconds after saving before you close the script, to allow it time to finish saving.

When you have finished making or editing your script, copy it from the robot to your computer using

```bash
scp nubots@<address>:<path_to_script> <path_on_your_computer>
```

`<address>` is the address of the robot, such as `10.1.1.1` for NUgus 1. `<path_to_script>` is the path to the script. `<path_on_your_computer>` is the path you want to copy the script to on your computer. Run this command on your computer.

After you copy the script to your computer, you should commit it to a new branch and make a pull request to merge it into the `main` branch on GitHub; unless the changes are not suitable to keep, in which case you can discard them.
