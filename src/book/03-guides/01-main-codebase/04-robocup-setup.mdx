## Networking

1. On the robot with a monitor and keyboard, not via `ssh`.
2. Rename `system/nugusX/etc/systemd/network/40-wlp58s0-robocup.network`
   to `system/nugusX/etc/systemd/network/30-wlp58s0.network`
3. Rename `system/defualt/etc/systemd/30-wlp58s0.network` to `system/default/etc/systemd/40-wlp58s0-robocup.network`
4. Double check that `Address`, in the file now called `30-wlp58s0.network`, is in the subnet you are connecting to,
   this is the address of this robot.
   Usually the subnet mask is `255.255.0.0` meaning that the first two numbers define the subnet.
   Usually the address of the subnet is `192.168.X.X` or `10.1.X.X`.
5. Also check that `Gateway` and the first `DNS` are correct in this file, both gateway and dns normally end with
   `.3.1` and are in the subnet.
6. Add the output of `wpa_passphrase SSID PASSWORD` to `system/default/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp58s0.conf`
   where `SSID` is the SSID and `PASSWORD` is the password of the Wi-Fi network you are connecting to.
   Now add `priority=3` inside the curly brackets on a new line to the entry that you just added.
   You can use `vim` or `nano` to edit files on the robot.
7. Run `sudo ./system_configuration`.
8. Reboot the robot `reboot` or restart the services
   `sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant@wlp58s0` and `sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant@wlp58s0`.

Note that steps before `7` will be overwritten when installing the codebase onto to robot,
and when rerunning steps `7` and `8` it will set the network to what the files in steps `1-6` indicate.
You can create a robocup branch, on your computer, with these files edited in the
`modules/tools/SystemConfiguration/data/` folder, so it will not be overwritten when installing.
