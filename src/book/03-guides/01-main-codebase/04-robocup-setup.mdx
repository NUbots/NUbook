## Networking

1.  Checkout the branch for robocup and change directory to `modules/tools/SystemConfiguration/data/system`.
2.  Rename `default/etc/systemd/30-wlp58s0.network` to `default/etc/systemd/40-wlp58s0-robocup.network`
3.  Add the output of `wpa_passphrase SSID PASSWORD` to `default/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant-wlp58s0.conf`
    where `SSID` and `PASSWORD` are the SSID and the password of the Wi-Fi network you are connecting to.
    Now add `priority=3` inside the curly brackets on a new line to the entry that you just added.
    The block should look like, where `HASHED_PASSWORD` is a long string of letters and numbers
    ```
    network={
           ssid="SSID"
           #psk="PASSWORD"
           psk=HASHED_PASSWORD
           priority=3
    }
    ```
4.  For each robot `X` do steps 5 to 10.
5.  Rename `nugusX/etc/systemd/network/40-wlp58s0-robocup.network`
    to `nugusX/etc/systemd/network/30-wlp58s0.network`.
6.  Double check that `Address`, in the file now called `30-wlp58s0.network`, is in the subnet you are connecting to,
    this is the address of this robot.
    Usually the subnet mask is `255.255.0.0` meaning that the first two numbers define the subnet.
    Usually the address of the robot is `192.168.TEAM_NUMBER.ROBOT_NUMBER` or `10.1.TEAM_NUMBER.ROBOT_NUMBER`.
7.  Normally `Gateway` and `DNS` are not needed for robocup so remove them from the file.
8.  Change directory back to the root of the NUbots repo and install the configs `./b install -co nX`.
    <Alert type='info'>

    When running via `ssh` make sure that you have a monitor and keyboard handy to handle any mistakes.

    </Alert>

9.  Run `sudo ./system_configuration` on the robot.
```sh
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd 
$ sudo systemctl restart wpa_supplicant@wlp58s0
