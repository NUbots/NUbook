Scripts are static motions for the robot. They specify what joint angles to move to and how long the robot should take to go to those joint positions. For example, standing up is a small script telling the robot to move their joints to the stand position over one second. There can be many of these position specifications in a row to make the robot do more complex movements like getting up or kicking.

The Script Engine executes script files by performing the robot motions that they describe. It takes each joint position and time from the `.yaml` file and sends the information to the servos, causing the robot to move.

Information on Script Engine is on the [Motion](/system/subsystems/motion#script-engine) page. Information on Script Runner and Script Tuner is on the [Behaviour](/system/subsystems/behaviour#script-runner) page.

## Script Runner

The `scriptrunner` command will run a script. It is used as follows:

```bash
./scriptrunner Script.yaml
```

Where you would replace `Script.yaml` with the name of the script. All scripts can be found in the NUbots repository under `/module/motion/ScriptEngine/data/scripts/`.

The script you are running needs to be on the robot in the `/scripts/` folder. These scripts can be robot specific. For example, you could have a stand script specifically for the NUgus 1 robot stored in `/scripts/nugus1/Stand.yaml`. When you run `./scriptrunner Stand.yaml` on NUgus 1, the ScriptEngine will first look for the robot-specific `Stand.yaml` in the `/scripts/nugus1/` folder. If found, it will execute it. If not, it will look for a platform-specific `Stand.yaml` in the `/scripts/nugus/` folder, which it will execute if found. Otherwise, it will look for a more general `Stand.yaml` in the `/scripts/` folder.

## Script Tuner

Script tuner is a tool that can be used to create and modify scripts. To use script tuner, run:

```bash
./scripttuner /path/to/Script.yaml
```

Where `Script.yaml` is either the name of an existing script, if you want to edit it, or the name for a new script. `/path/to/Script.yaml` is the path to the script. This may be `scripts/nugus/Script.yaml`, or `scripts/nugus*/Script.yaml` where `*` is the robot number for a robot specific script.

Running a command like the above will open the following interface, which will enable you to tune the script:

![First line states 'Scripts: scripts/nugus2/walk.yaml'. Next line says 'Frames:' with consecutive numbers from 1 to 44 laid out in a row. The number '1' is selected. The next line says 'Duration: 3000'. The next section is a table with the first column specifying servo names such as 'right shoulder pitch'. The second column specifies the angle of the servo. This is of the format 'Angle: +1.45'. Some of the rows have dashes instead of numbers for the angle, denoting an empty field. The third row states the gain of the servo. This is of the form 'Gain: 30.0'. Like the angle, some of these are blanked out with dashes. Empty angle and gain fields are paired. In the next section there are several keyboard commands which allow the user to use the interface.](./images/scripttuner.png)

The first line tells you the name and path of the script you are creating or editing.

The second line specifies the number of frames and the current frame, which is highlighted. Each frame specifies different joint (i.e. servo) positions, and when these frames are combined they result in a motion.

The next line is the duration. This determines how long the robot will take to move to the servo positions you have specified. This is measured in milliseconds.

The next section is a table that shows the angle and gain for each servo for that frame.

The bottom of the interface shows what commands are available. It does not show all the commands. All commands can be viewed by typing `:help` and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>. Note that the letters should be pressed in UPPERCASE.

Otherwise the one before will be selected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| <kbd>space</kbd>               | Toggles locking and unlocking of servos. When a servo is locked, you will not be able to manually move its joint on the robot, and the angle it is at will be stored in the table on the script tuner interface. When it is unlocked, you are able to freely move that joint on the robot to adjust the angle of the joint for that frame. Space bar can be pressed to edit any field that is editable. |

## Modifying and Adding Scripts

When installing NUbots code onto a robot for tuning scripts, ensure you are using [the correct flag for installing configuration files](/system/foundations/build-system#install), depending on whether you want to overwrite existing scripts on the robot, or not. Also ensure that enable the `scripttuner` and `scriptrunner` binaries by turning `scripttuner.role` and `scriptrunner.role` ON in `./b configure -i`, before building and installing.

Use script tuner as detailed above to make or edit your script. It is a good idea to have one person using script tuner and another person holding the robot and moving the joints to new positions. Wait a few seconds after saving before you close the script, to allow it time to finish saving.

When you have finished making or editing your script, copy it from the robot to your computer using

```bash
scp nubots@<address>:<path/to/script> <path/on/your/computer>
```

where `<address>` is the address of the robot, `<path/to/script>` is the path to the script, and `<path/on/your/computer>` is the path you want to copy the script to. Run this command on your computer.

After you copy the script to your computer, you should commit it to a new branch and make a pull request to get it added to the `master` branch on GitHub; unless the changes are not suitable to keep, in which case you can discard them.
