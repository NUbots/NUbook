All the NUbots code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/NUbots/). To contribute to any NUbots code, you will need to create a GitHub account. A useful GUI for GitHub repositories is [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/). The main repositories on GitHub for NUbots are the NUbots repository (main codebase) and NUsight2 repository (debugging tool).

For communicating with other team members we use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/). When you join the team, ask someone to send you an invite to our Slack workspace! 

NUbots also has a social media presence. We have a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NubotsRobotics/) page, so make sure to send us a like if youâ€™re interested in robotics!
