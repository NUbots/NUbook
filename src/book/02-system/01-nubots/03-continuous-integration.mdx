## Overview

NUbots uses [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com) for its continuous integration pipeline. The Buildkite server listens for code changes on GitHub and issues build jobs to our build agents (the iMacs in the lab), as they become available.

This CI process works in combination with the [Git Feature Branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) we use for development:

1. Developers branch off `master`, creating a new branch with a name of the form `<lastname>/<purpose-of-branch>`. For example:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b biddulph/ball-detector
   ```

2. Once development on the branch is complete, or reaches a point where it can be reviewed, the developer makes a pull request on GitHub. This triggers a webhook to Buildkite to build and test the PR.
3. Buildkite receives the webhook and creates separate build jobs for different parts of the PR (build, check code format, test, etc) and sends different jobs to different agents based on their availability.
4. Agents receive a job, clone the code, pull the existing `master` image for DockerHub, and build any new Docker changes. They then mount the code and run the job in a container based on the image, reporting the results back to Buildkite.
5. Buildkite receives the results and updates the build status in the Buildkite UI as well as on the PR page on GitHub.
6. When the build passes, the pull request is reviewed by another member of the team and merged into `master` only when approved.
7. Merging into `master` then triggers another CI build. This time, in addition to building the code, a separate job is created to rebuild the master image and push it to DockerHub.

## Buildkite Agent Setup (Ubuntu)

The following instructions show how to setup and configure a new Buildkite agent with Docker and Docker Compose. These steps have been collected into a [single script you can download here](assets/ci_setup.sh). Before running the script, ensure you have set the Buildkite agent token and DockerHub password correctly in the env variables at the top of the script. Also, make sure to run the script with `sudo`.

<Alert type="warning">

**Note:** the final step below, [Install Docker Compose](#install-docker-compose), is not in the script, and must be done manually in order to install the latest version.

</Alert>

### Install Docker

Steps from <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/>.

```bash
# Remove old Docker
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc

# Install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

# Add Docker’s official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Add Docker's stable repository
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
​
# Install latest Docker CE
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

### Configure Docker

Steps from <https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/>.

```bash
# Create a 'docker' user group and add local users to allow for use without sudo
sudo groupadd docker                     # Create user group
sudo usermod -aG docker nubots           # Add nubots to the group
sudo usermod -aG docker buildkite-agent  # Add buildkite-agent to the group
newgrp docker                            # Activate group changes

# Configure Docker to run on boot
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

### Install and Configure Buildkite

Steps from <https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/ubuntu>.

```bash
# Add the signed Buildkite apt repository
echo "deb https://apt.buildkite.com/buildkite-agent stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/buildkite-agent.list
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 32A37959C2FA5C3C99EFBC32A79206696452D198

# Install Buildkite the agent
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y buildkite-agent

# Add the agent token to the configuration file.
# Replace INSERT-YOUR-AGENT-TOKEN-HERE with the token from Buildkite.
sudo sed -i "s/xxx/INSERT-YOUR-AGENT-TOKEN-HERE/g" /etc/buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg

# Start the agent and schedule it to run on system startup
sudo systemctl enable buildkite-agent && sudo systemctl start buildkite-agent
```

### Add DockerHub Credentials to Buildkite

For agents to push built `master` images to DockerHub, they need the service account login credentials. The username of this account is `nubotsdocker`, and is specified in the Buildkite [pipeline file](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/e7db7154a689ab076041375894b3baf1d53a2587/.buildkite/pipeline.yml#L11). The password needs to be made available to the agent when it runs, via the `DOCKER_LOGIN_PASSWORD` env variable.

One way to provide credentials to the agent via env variables is to use the agent hooks system. The default directory for agent hooks is `/etc/buildkite-agent/hooks`. The default path for the agent's configuration file is `/etc/buildkite-agent/buildkite-agent.cfg`.

See the following pages in the Buildkite documentation for reference:

- <https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/hooks>
- <https://buildkite.com/docs/agent/v3/configuration>

### Install Docker Compose

Follow the instructions here to install the latest version of Docker Compose: <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>
