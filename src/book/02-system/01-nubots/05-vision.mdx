The vision system aims to convert images from a camera in the robot into useful information, such as the position of balls, goal posts, field lines and obstacles. This information is used to determine behaviour and localisation. The vision system encompasses [hardware](/system/hardware/overview#cameras), object detection, and post-processing.

# Cameras

The cameras have the following parameters that are used by the object detection algorithm.

| Parameter           | Type                 | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serial_number`     | string               | The serial number of the camera. This is used to identify the camera and distinguish it from other cameras in the robot.                              |
| `lens.projection`   | string               | The lens projection type. Can be rectilinear, equidistant or equisold.                                                                                |
| `lens.focal_length` | float                | The normalised focal length. It is defined as focal length in pixels divided by image width. The focal length is the angle of view and magnification. |
| `lens.center`       | 2-dimensional vector | The normalised image centre offset. Represents the pixels from the centre of the image to the optical axis, divided by the image width                |
| `k`                 | 2-dimensional vector | The polynomial distortion coefficients for the length                                                                                                 |
| `fov`               | float (radians)      | Field of view. The angular diameter that the lens covers (the area that light hits on the sensor).                                                    |
| `Hpc`               | 4x4 matrix           | Homogeneous transform from the rigid platform this camera is attached to (pitch servo) to the camera's virtual focal point.                           |

These parameters are set for each camera as **configuration values** in the [Camera module](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/input/Camera/data/config), in each robot's respective folder. The values for the left camera on the robot will be stored in `Left.yaml`. The values for the right camera on the robot will be stored in `Right.yaml`.

The parameters are used in the **Camera module** to find and set up the cameras. The Camera module emits [Image messages](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/shared/message/input/Image.proto).

The [projection tool](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/shared/utility/vision/projection.h), based on [panotools' fisheye projection calculations](https://wiki.panotools.org/Fisheye_Projection), maps a portion of the surface of a sphere to a flat image. The type of projection is specified by the above parameter `len.projection`.

# Visual Mesh

## Algorithm

The [Visual Mesh](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-27544-0_4) underpins the vision system and is used for sparse **detection** of balls, points on the field, field lines, goal posts and other robots. It is an **input transformation** that uses knowledge of a camera's orientation and position relative to an observation plane to increase the performance and accuracy of a **convolutional neural network**. It utilises the **geometry of objects** to create a **mesh structure** that gives high accuracy of detection regardless of the distance to the object.

The **height** and **orientation** of the camera is tracked using the kinematics and inertial measurement unit of the robot. The **lens type** and the expected **radius** of any soccer ball are given as a configuration value. These values are used to create a set of **unit vectors** with the origin at the camera position. These unit vectors represent rays of light travelling towards the camera. Each vector is **mapped** to a **point on the image** using an appropriate lens projection equation. Two equations are used to efficiently sample the space around the camera to obtain the **array of vectors** and associated **sample points**.

Each **sample point** is connected to its **six closest neighbours**. These connections become the **edges** of the mesh. A fully [convolutional neural network](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2016.2572683) is used on the mesh where each sample point and its neighbours become the **input to a convolution**. All layers in the network use **seven point convolutions**, representing a point and its six neighbours. The number of sample points determines the level of detail available to the network. The **output of the network** is a **label** to each point specifying what class it belongs to. This could be a ball, goal-post, field, field line, robot, or none.

The mesh constructed is **one possible mesh**. Various meshes can be created with different values for the **height**, **orientation**, **lens type** and **radius** of a soccer ball. The algorithm creates **many different meshes** for different **height and radius** pairs on startup. For each image, we find the appropriate mesh based on the height and radius values for that image. The **vectors** used for the mesh are determined based on the **orientation**, and are selected using binary search.

## Implementation

The Visual Mesh implementation can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/Fastcode/VisualMesh). It has implementations for using **circle, spherical or cylinder geometry** for the mesh. The Visual Mesh implementation uses **TensorFlow** for training. The Visual Mesh can be used with the **CPU engine** with C++ code or it can be used with the **OpenCL engine** on CPUs and many GPUs.

In the NUbots codebase, the Visual Mesh is used in the [Visual Mesh module](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/vision/VisualMesh). **Network biases and weights** are found in the **configuration file** in the module, along with other Visual Mesh parameters such as geometry type. The module receives an **Image message** from the Camera module, detailed above, and inputs it into the Visual Mesh. The resulting **mesh and classifications** are output as a [VisualMesh message](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/vision/VisualMesh.proto). This message can then be used in [post-processing](#post-processing).

# Post-Processing

From the Visual Mesh a series of specialised detectors are employed to detect field edges, balls, and goal posts. The **green horizon** detector uses information from the Visual Mesh message as detailed above. The **goal** and **ball detectors** use the information given by the green horizon detector in the [GreenHorizon message](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/vision/GreenHorizon.proto).

All calculations in the detectors are done in **3D world coordinates**. To find out more about the mathematics used at NUbots, check out [the mathematics page](/system/nubots/mathematics).

## Green Horizon Detector

When the [green horizon detector](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/module/vision/GreenHorizonDetector/) receives a VisualMesh message, it uses the information in this message to create one large **cluster** of points that is determined to be the field.

The points are first filtered to give only potential field points. The first field point is added to a cluster with all its **field point neighbours**. Neighbouring field points are added to the cluster until all field points who are neighbours of the points in the cluster are added to the cluster.

Clustering is repeated until all field points are part of a cluster. Clusters that are smaller than a given threshold are **discarded**. Clusters are **merged** unless they overlap. If the clusters overlap, we keep the larger cluster and discard the smaller cluster.

After clustering has finished, one cluster will remain which should represent **the field**. An **upper convex hull algorithm** is applied to the final cluster to determine the edge of the field. The detector will emit a **GreenHorizon message** that specifies the location of the edge of the field.

## Ball Detector

The [ball detector](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/module/vision/BallDetector/) receives a GreenHorizon message and a [FieldDescription message](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/support/FieldDescription.proto). The FieldDescription message is output by the [SoccerConfig module](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/support/configuration/SoccerConfig) which creates the FieldDescription message from configuration values specifying the layout of the soccer field as well as the radius of the ball being used.

The ball detector forms **clusters** out of all the points that the Visual Mesh has identified as ball points. Specifically, the clusters are formed from Visual Mesh points that are identified as being a ball point but have at least $1$ neighbour which is **not** a ball point. This allows us to form clusters of ball edge points. Clusters are discarded if they fail to meet any of the following criteria

- The cluster is below the green horizon.

- The cluster is larger than a given threshold.

Remaining clusters are fitted with a **circular cone**. The **cone axis** is determined from the line segment between the centre of the camera and the centre of the ball, determined by averaging all of the ball edge points. The **radius** of the cone is determined by the maximum distance between the ball edge points and the centre of the ball. Clusters are **discarded** if they fail to meet any of the following criteria

- The cluster fits the **shape of a circle** well enough to be a ball. We use a degree of circle fit to determine this. This involves calculating the standard deviation of the angle between all the rays in the cluster. The standard deviation must not exceed a given threshold.

  $$
  \text{angle}_i = \frac{\text{axis} \cdot \text{ray}_i}{ \text{radius}_{\text{max}}}
  $$

  $$
  \text{mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^n \text{angle}_i}{n}
  $$

  $$
  \text{standard deviation} = \sum_{i=0}^n (\text{mean} - \text{angle}_i)^2
  $$

  - $\text{axis}$ is the cone axis of the cluster
  - $\text{ray}_i$ is the ray vector of the $i$th point in the cluster
  - $\text{radius}_{\text{max}}$ is the maximum radius allowed

- The distance to the cluster is larger than a given minimum distance.

- The difference between the [angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_diameter) and projection-based sizes of the cluster is within a given threshold.

  $$
  r_a = \frac{r_b}{\sqrt{1 - r^2}}
  $$

  $$
  r_p = \lVert \text{axis} \cdot \frac{r_b - \text{rWCc.z}}{\text{axis.z}} + \text{rWCc} \rVert
  $$

  - $r_a$ is the angular-based size
  - $r_p$ is the projection-based size
  - $r_b$ is the actual ball radius we are expecting
  - $r$ is the calculated cluster radius
  - axis is the cone axis as specified above
  - rWCc is the vector from camera to world in camera space. For more information on this convention, see the [Mathematics](/system/nubots/mathematics#homogeneous-transformations) page.

- The cluster must have a distance less than the length of the field, as given by the FieldDescription message.

Any remaining clusters are assumed to be balls and so are emitted together as a [Balls message](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/vision/Ball.proto).

## Goal Detector

The [goal detector](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/module/vision/GoalDetector/src/GoalDetector.cpp) follows a similar structure to the ball detector. It receives a GreenHorizon and a FieldDescription message.

All goal post edge points (points that are goal points that have at least one neighbour that is **not** a goal point) are found and partitioned into clusters. Clusters are **discarded** if they fail to meet any of the following criteria

- The cluster intersects the green horizon (we assume goals are higher than the field)

- The cluster is larger than a given threshold

The bottom centre point of each cluster is then found by averaging the edge points. This is the point where we measure the distance from. If there is more than one cluster, i.e. more than one goal post, an attempt is made to pair up the goal posts. This is done by calculating the distances between the posts and pairing up goal posts which are close together. **Leftness** and **rightness** is assigned to each post in a pair based on their positions.

The goal detector then emits any goals as a [Goals message](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/vision/Goal.proto).
