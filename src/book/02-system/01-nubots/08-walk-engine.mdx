Currently NUbots has two walk engines. One is an **open loop hybrid walk controller** and the other is an **open loop walk** based on **quintic splines**. These engines take care of the mathematics and control involved in taking steps without falling over. The walk engines do not plan where to walk to, only how to walk.

A walk engine will trigger when a [**walkcommand**](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/motion/WalkCommand.proto) is [emitted](/system/nubots/nuclear#emit-statements). The walk command gives a vector [x, y, z] which represents:

| Variable | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| x        | velocity in metres per second |
| y        | velocity in metres per second |
| z        | angle in radians per second   |

The [Direct Walk Controller](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/behaviour/skills/DirectWalkController) sends messages to the walk engine. It can send a message to enable or disable the walk engine, stop the walk engine, or send a walkcommand message to the walk engine.

The [behaviour](system/nubots/behaviour) of the robot determines where it will walk to.

## Open Loop Hybrid Walk

This walk is an **open loop hybrid walk controller**, dynamically switching between an analytically solved trajectory for the centre of mass based on the **linear inverted pendulum model**, and a **Zero Moment Point preview controller**, based on the work of [Yi et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2013.7029960) and Song ('Development of an Omni-directional Gait Generator and a Stabilization Feedback Controller for Humanoid Robots'). To add local feedback, positions for the pitch and roll ankle joints are prescribed based on information from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to counteract small imbalances.

## Quintic Spline Walk

The Quintic Walk is an **open loop controller** based on **quintic splines** (piecewise fifth degree polynomials). It sets points in each direction for rotation and translation and uses those points to create smooth quintic splines.

The engine has support for kicking, however this is not used at this time.

The code used for this walk comes from [**BitBots**](https://github.com/bit-bots/bitbots_motion/), which in turn was based off [Quentin "Leph" Rouxel and Team Rhoban's walk](https://github.com/Rhoban/model/).

## Keyboard Walk

The [keyboardwalk module](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/behaviour/strategy/KeyboardWalk) is used for **testing** and **demonstration** purposes. Keyboard walk can use any of the walk engines in the codebase.

Keyboard walk acts as an interface for using one of these walks. Keyboard walk uses **keyboard inputs** to control the robot. The inputs available are detailed in the following table.

| Command            | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <kbd>e</kbd>       | Toggles the walk on and off. Initially it is off.                         |
| <kbd>w</kbd>       | Adds 0.1 to the walk command x-value. This value is in meters/second.     |
| <kbd>s</kbd>       | Adds -0.1 to the walk command x-value. This value is in meters/second.    |
| <kbd>a</kbd>       | Adds 0.1 to the walk command y-value. This value is in meters/second.     |
| <kbd>d</kbd>       | Adds -0.1 to the walk command y-value. This value is in meters/second.    |
| <kbd>z</kbd>       | Adds 0.1 to the walk command z-value. This value is in radians/second.    |
| <kbd>x</kbd>       | Adds -0.1 to the walk command z-value. This value is in radians/second.   |
| <kbd>,</kbd>       | Runs the kick with the left foot.                                         |
| <kbd>.</kbd>       | Runs the kick with the right foot.                                        |
| <kbd>g</kbd>       | Runs the get up.                                                          |
| <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> | Head turns to the left.                                                   |
| <kbd>&#8594;</kbd> | Head turns to the right.                                                  |
| <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> | Head turns upwards.                                                       |
| <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> | Head turns downwards.                                                     |
| <kbd>r</kbd>       | Resets keyboardwalk. Head rotation is set to 0. Walk command is set to 0. |
| <kbd>q</kbd>       | Quits keyboardwalk.                                                       |

To use KeyboardWalk, build the [keyboardwalk role](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/roles/keyboardwalk.role) and run the binary.

The [**keyboardwalkfake** role](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/roles/keyboardwalkfake.role) uses HardwareSimulator, for when you don't want to run keyboard walk on the robot.

## PS3 Walk

The [PS3 walk module](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/behaviour/strategy/PS3Walk) is an interface for **testing** and **demonstrating** the walk and other functionalities using a **PS3 controller**.

The module connects to the PS3 controller using bluetooth and reacts based on the joystick or button input.

| Command                   | Description                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Left Joystick Horizontal  | Adds rotational speed to the walk command. |
| Left Joystick Vertical    | Adds x speed to the walk command.          |
| Right Joystick Horizontal | Changes the head yaw.                      |
| Right Joystick Vertical   | Changes the head pitch.                    |
| TRIANGLE                  | Toggles walking on/off.                    |
| SQUARE                    | Toggles locking of the head.               |
| R2                        | Right kick.                                |

To use this module, build the [PS3Walk role](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/roles/ps3walk.role) and run the binary. Plug the PS3 controller into the robot using a USB cable. When the controller is connected to the robot, you can remove the cable.
