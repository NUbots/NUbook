NUClear is the software framework used in the main NUbots codebase. It is a message passing system designed to be modular and fast. The [NUClear readthedocs page](https://nuclear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) contains a detailed description of NUClear, which this page is based off. The [NUClear Roles repository](https://github.com/Fastcode/NUClearRoles) contains a detailed description of the NUClear roles system, much of which the [roles section](/system/nubots/nuclear/#nuclear-roles) in this page is based off.

# Components

## PowerPlant

The PowerPlant is the central message system through which reactors communicate. It takes ownership of any data emitted by reactors into the system and executes the required reactions. NUClear is [multi-threaded](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_(computer_architecture)>). The PowerPlant handles all threading logic.

## Reactors

A reactor can be thought of as a module. All modules in the NUClear system are an extension of `NUClear::Reactor`. Reactors define reactions and the conditions under which they will process. They may also emit data to the PowerPlant.

## Reactions and Tasks

Reactions run tasks when the required data is available and/or when certain conditions are true. A task is the current execution of a defined reaction within the system. These functions are bound by NUClear as callbacks, and it is the execution of these callbacks which will assign tasks to a thread.

Reactions are created by subscribing to the PowerPlant through [DSL On Statements](/system/nubots/nuclear/#on-statements).

# NUClear Roles

The NUClear roles system is a build and messaging system for the NUClear framework. It uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) to manage the construction of various executables made up of a selection of modules. These executables are called roles.

CMake is used as the main system for generating the libraries and executables that are used for the final binary. Note that it utilises [globbing](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)>) to find the sources that are used for modules. If you add or remove a file, you must rerun cmake so that it locates the new files.
