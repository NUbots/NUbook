## Walk Engine

Currently NUbots has two walk engines. One is an **open loop hybrid walk controller** and the other is an **open loop walk** based on **quintic splines**. These engines take care of the mathematics and control involved in taking steps without falling over. The walk engines do not plan where to walk to, only how to walk.

A walk engine will trigger when a [**walkcommand**](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/motion/WalkCommand.proto) is [emitted](/system/foundations/nuclear#emit-statements). The walk command gives a vector [x, y, z] which represents:

| Variable | Description                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| x        | velocity in metres per second                                                              |
| y        | velocity in metres per second                                                              |
| z        | yaw in radians per second, positive is counter-clockwise. The 0 point is straight forward. |

The [behaviour](/system/subsystems/behaviour) of the robot determines what the walk command will be.

### Open Loop Hybrid Walk

This walk is an **open loop hybrid walk controller**, dynamically switching between an analytically solved trajectory for the centre of mass based on the **linear inverted pendulum model**, and a **Zero Moment Point preview controller**. To add local feedback, positions for the pitch and roll ankle joints are prescribed based on information from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to counteract small imbalances.

This walk is based on the work of [Yi et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2013.7029960) and Song ('Development of an Omni-directional Gait Generator and a Stabilization Feedback Controller for Humanoid Robots'). The code is a refactored version of the [UPennalizers](https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~robocup/wiki/) / Team DARwIn [2013 code release](https://github.com/UPenn-RoboCup/UPennalizers/tree/master). NUbots have made several improvements and simplifications.

The module for this walk is located in the [OldWalkEngine module folder](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/motion/OldWalkEngine).

### Quintic Spline Walk

The Quintic Walk is an **open loop controller** based on **quintic splines** (piecewise fifth degree polynomials). It sets points in each direction for rotation and translation and uses those points to create smooth quintic splines.

The engine has support for kicking, however this is not used at this time.

The code used for this walk comes from [**BitBots**](https://github.com/bit-bots/bitbots_motion/), which in turn was based off [Quentin "Leph" Rouxel and Team Rhoban's walk](https://github.com/Rhoban/model/).

The implementation of this walk is currently a work in progress. See the implementation on the [QuinticWalk branch](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/biddulph/quintic_walk/module/motion/QuinticWalk).

#### Implementation

The walk uses the Footstep class to generate the targets for the foot, which are based off the calculated splines.

The SplineContainer class holds Points and multiple Spline objects. As the SplineContainer gets points, it creates Splines based on these points. These Spline objects are each mapped to names.

The Spline that the SplineContainer holds is a generic Spline class that holds all the information for a mathematical spline. Each piecewise polynomial in the spline is represented by a Polynom object that contains the coefficients for a polynomial.

The specific Spline type we use is a SmoothSpline, extended from the Spline class. Find out more about splines and this specific type of spline on the [mathematics](/system/foundations/mathematics#splines) page.

The TrajectoryUtils file specifies the usage of the SplineContainer for the purpose of walking. It creates a SplineContainer with the following Splines

| Name                 | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IS_DOUBLE_SUPPORT    | Splines for when the robot is in double support phase, i.e. both feet are on the ground. |
| IS_LEFT_SUPPORT_FOOT | Splines for the support foot.                                                            |
| TRUNK_POS_X          | The Cartesian position of the robot's torso in the x-axis.                               |
| TRUNK_POS_Y          | The Cartesian position of the robot's torso in the y-axis.                               |
| TRUNK_POS_Z          | The Cartesian position of the robot's torso in the z-axis.                               |
| TRUNK_AXIS_X         | The orientation - x-axis of the robot's torso.                                           |
| TRUNK_AXIS_Y         | The orientation - y-axis of the robot's torso.                                           |
| TRUNK_AXIS_Z         | The orientation - z-axis of the robot's torso.                                           |
| FOOT_POS_X           | The Cartesian position of the robot's flying foot in the x-axis.                         |
| FOOT_POS_Y           | The Cartesian position of the robot's flying foot in the y-axis.                         |
| FOOT_POS_Z           | The Cartesian position of the robot's flying foot in the z-axis.                         |
| FOOT_AXIS_X          | The orientation - x-axis of the robot's flying foot.                                     |
| FOOT_AXIS_Y          | The orientation - y-axis of the robot's flying foot.                                     |
| FOOT_AXIS_Z          | The orientation - z-axis of the robot's flying foot.                                     |

The points that make up all these splines can be found in the [WalkEngine.cpp file](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/ff2cf1f7f38bf558494e305a99544e15affaf719/module/motion/QuinticWalk/src/engine/WalkEngine.cpp#L331). The [configuration parameters](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/biddulph/quintic_walk/module/motion/QuinticWalk/data/config/QuinticWalk.yaml) affect some of these points. Values are all in [SI units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units).

The motion subsystem contains modules that are responsible for walking, kicking, moving the head, and running scripts. They perform these motions by sending servo commands (called targets) to the motors.

The Script Engine is detailed on this page, while Script Runner and Script Tuner can be found on the [Behaviour](/system/subsystems/behaviour#script-runner) page.

## Script Engine

Scripts are static motions for the robot. They specify what joint angles to move to and how long the robot should take to get to those joint angles. For example, standing up is a script telling the robot to move its joints to the stand position over one second. There can be many of these position specifications in sequence to make the robot do more complex movements like getting up or kicking.

To learn how to tune scripts, see the [ScriptTuner guide](/guides/main/tuning-and-running-scripts#script-tuner).

### Messages

To execute a script, we emit an "execute script" message describing the script to execute. This message is received in the ScriptEngine, which executes the appropriate script. These are specified in [Script.h](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/shared/extension/Script.h) as [ExecuteScriptByName](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/shared/extension/Script.h#L224) and [ExecuteScript](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/shared/extension/Script.h#L261).

`ExecuteScriptByName` takes

- a subsumption ID (this is used to determine servo access priority)
- the name of the script/s as a string or a vector of strings
- the duration of the scripts
- the time that these scripts should start executing

An example of receiving this message is in [ScriptEngine.cpp](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/module/motion/ScriptEngine/src/ScriptEngine.cpp#L51).

```cpp
on<Trigger<ExecuteScriptByName>>().then([this](const ExecuteScriptByName& command) {...}
```

An example of emitting this message is in [KickScript.cpp](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/module/behaviour/skills/KickScript/src/KickScript.cpp#L102)

```cpp
emit(std::make_unique<ExecuteScriptByName>(
    id, std::vector<std::string>({"Stand.yaml", "KickRight.yaml", "Stand.yaml"})));
```

Note these are only the names of the scripts, not the full paths. The names correspond to the names of YAML files in the [scripts folder](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/16b4b20faf69c2c12b52e9ffd28c546a612dc033/module/motion/ScriptEngine/data/scripts).

In addition to using the name of a script, we can also use [an instance of Script](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/shared/extension/Script.h#L43) directly. `Script` can be instantiated with all the information for the script to execute, and can be emitted using the `ExecuteScript` message. `ExecuteScript` takes:

- a subsumption ID (this is used to determine servo access priority)
- a Script or vector of Scripts
- the duration of the scripts
- the time that these scripts should start executing

An example of receiving this messages is in [ScriptEngine.cpp](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/module/motion/ScriptEngine/src/ScriptEngine.cpp#L71)

```cpp
on<Trigger<ExecuteScript>>().then([this](const ExecuteScript& command) {...}
```

An example of emitting this message is in [ScriptTuner.cpp](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/module/behaviour/tools/ScriptTuner/src/ScriptTuner.cpp#L590)

```cpp
emit(std::make_unique<ExecuteScript>(id, script, NUClear::clock::now()));
```

The [ScriptEngine](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/96357855b059cd499021552b3e25a4b158828dc5/module/motion/ScriptEngine) module receives either of these messages and processes the information for the script. It collects the servo positions and time for each frame and modifies them if needed based on the given duration and start time in the message. The information is then emitted as a [ServoCommand](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/cbb5d3ebc2a7c56944ec9afe3f70faf7e2900217/shared/message/behaviour/ServoCommand.proto) message.

### Script files

The script files are YAML files specifying a duration and list of servo targets, in a format like the following:

```yaml
- duration: 1000
  targets:
    - id: HEAD_YAW
      position: 0
      gain: 30
      torque: 100
    - id: HEAD_PITCH
      position: 0.5
      gain: 30
      torque: 100
    - id: R_HIP_YAW
      position: -0.03
      gain: 20
      torque: 100
```

The fields are described in the table below.

| Field      | Description                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `duration` | An integer in milliseconds.                                                                                                                                    |
| `position` | A float representing the angle of the servo in radians.                                                                                                        |
| `gain`     | A float representing how much effort the servo will use to get to the target position. Gain is often between 10 and 30.                                        |
| `torque`   | A float, where 0 represents no torque and 100 represents torque being on. Torque is 100 unless you want that servo relaxed, in which case it will be 0.        |
| `id`       | One of the servo IDs listed in [ServoID.h](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/467f458c687419056e2487fe468c7f22d19a6965/shared/utility/input/ServoID.h#L30). |

Script files can be found in the ScriptEngine module. Scripts can be specific to a robot. More on scripts can be found on the [Configuration and Script System](/system/foundations/config-script) page.
