# Walk Engine

Currently NUbots has two walk engines. One is an **open loop hybrid walk controller** and the other is an **open loop walk** based on **quintic splines**. These engines take care of the mathematics and control involved in taking steps without falling over. The walk engines do not plan where to walk to, only how to walk.

A walk engine will trigger when a [**walkcommand**](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/master/shared/message/motion/WalkCommand.proto) is [emitted](/system/foundations/nuclear#emit-statements). The walk command gives a vector [x, y, z] which represents:

| Variable | Description                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| x        | velocity in metres per second                                                              |
| y        | velocity in metres per second                                                              |
| z        | yaw in radians per second, positive is counter-clockwise. The 0 point is straight forward. |

The [behaviour](/system/subsystems/behaviour) of the robot determines what the walk command will be.

## Open Loop Hybrid Walk

This walk is an **open loop hybrid walk controller**, dynamically switching between an analytically solved trajectory for the centre of mass based on the **linear inverted pendulum model**, and a **Zero Moment Point preview controller**. To add local feedback, positions for the pitch and roll ankle joints are prescribed based on information from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to counteract small imbalances.

This walk is based on the work of [Yi et al.](https://doi.org/10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2013.7029960) and Song ('Development of an Omni-directional Gait Generator and a Stabilization Feedback Controller for Humanoid Robots'). The code is a refactored version of the [UPennalizers](https://fling.seas.upenn.edu/~robocup/wiki/) / Team DARwIn [2013 code release](https://github.com/UPenn-RoboCup/UPennalizers/tree/master). NUbots have made several improvements and simplifications.

The module for this walk is located in the [OldWalkEngine module folder](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/master/module/motion/OldWalkEngine).

## Quintic Spline Walk

The Quintic Walk is an **open loop controller** based on **quintic splines** (piecewise fifth degree polynomials). It sets points in each direction for rotation and translation and uses those points to create smooth quintic splines.

The engine has support for kicking, however this is not used at this time.

The code used for this walk comes from [**BitBots**](https://github.com/bit-bots/bitbots_motion/), which in turn was based off [Quentin "Leph" Rouxel and Team Rhoban's walk](https://github.com/Rhoban/model/).

The implementation of this walk is currently a work in progress. See the implementation on the [QuinticWalk branch](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/biddulph/quintic_walk/module/motion/QuinticWalk).

### Implementation

The walk uses the Footstep class to generate the targets for the foot. It handles the special cases of side stepping and turning to prevent collisions with the other foot.

The SplineContainer class holds Points and multiple Spline objects. As the SplineContainer gets points, it creates Splines based on these points. These Spline objects are each mapped to names.

The Spline that the SplineContainer holds is a generic Spline class that holds all the information for a mathematical spline. Each piecewise polynomial in the spline is represented by a Polynom object that contains the coefficients for a polynomial.

The specific Spline type we use is a SmoothSpline, extended from the Spline class. Find out more about splines and this specific type of spline on the [mathematics](/system/foundations/mathematics#splines) page.

The TrajectoryUtils file specifies the usage of the SplineContainer for the purpose of walking. It creates a SplineContainer with the following Splines

| Name                 | Description                                                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IS_DOUBLE_SUPPORT    | Splines for when the robot is in double support phase, i.e. both feet are on the ground. |
| IS_LEFT_SUPPORT_FOOT | Splines for the support foot.                                                            |

| TRUNK_POS_Z          | The Cartesian position of the robot's torso in the z-axis.                               |
| TRUNK_AXIS_X         | The orientation - x-axis of the robot's torso.                                           |
| TRUNK_AXIS_Y         | The orientation - y-axis of the robot's torso.                                           |
| TRUNK_AXIS_Z         | The orientation - z-axis of the robot's torso.                                           |
| FOOT_POS_X           | The Cartesian position of the robot's flying foot in the x-axis.                         |
| FOOT_POS_Y           | The Cartesian position of the robot's flying foot in the y-axis.                         |
| FOOT_POS_Z           | The Cartesian position of the robot's flying foot in the z-axis.                         |
| FOOT_AXIS_X          | The orientation - x-axis of the robot's flying foot.                                     |
| FOOT_AXIS_Y          | The orientation - y-axis of the robot's flying foot.                                     |
| FOOT_AXIS_Z          | The orientation - z-axis of the robot's flying foot.                                     |

The points that make up all these splines can be found in the [WalkEngine.cpp file](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/ff2cf1f7f38bf558494e305a99544e15affaf719/module/motion/QuinticWalk/src/engine/WalkEngine.cpp#L331). The [configuration parameters](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/blob/biddulph/quintic_walk/module/motion/QuinticWalk/data/config/QuinticWalk.yaml) affect some of these points.
