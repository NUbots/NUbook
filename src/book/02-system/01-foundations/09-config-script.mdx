## The Configuration System

The NUbots configuration system is based on a hierarchical [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file system.

The hierarchical structure is as follows

```text
config/
├── nugus1/
│   └── ExampleModule.yaml
├── nugus2/
│   └── ExampleModule.yaml
├── robocup/
│   └── ExampleModule.yaml
└── ExampleModule.yaml
```

The file `config/ExampleModule.yaml` must exist for every module that uses configuration. This file defines all of the configuration for the module.
`config/nugus1/ExampleModule.yaml` is an optional file and allows you to provide robot-specific overrides for specific configuration values, in this case it would provide overrides for the `nugus1` robot.
Similarly, `config/robocup/ExampleModule.yaml` allows for the `robocup` role to further override configuration values.

It is intended that all configuration values exist in the default configuration file and that only a subset of configuration values appear in the robot-specific and role-specific override files.

<Alert type='info'>

There are exceptions to this, the `Camera` module being the best example.

The `Camera` module introduces the `serial_number` field in the robot-specific
override files as every robot will have different cameras installed in it.
However, it makes no sense for the default configuration file to contain the
`serial_number` field as there is no viable default value for this field.

</Alert>

The robot-specific override is intended to allow configuration values to be tweaked to account a slight variation in the robots hardware. For instance, the cameras on each robot have different serial numbers.

The role-specific override is intended to change a modules behaviour based on which role is running. For instance, disabling the transmission of certain NUsight2 traffic while playing a competition game.

To reiterate how the configuration system loads and merges configuration files

1. The default configuration file `config/ModuleName.yaml` is loaded. This forms the base configuration for the module
1. A check is made to see if `config/RobotName/ModuleName.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded and all values found therein override the equivalent values in the base configuration
1. A check is made to see if `config/RoleName/ModuleName.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded and all values found therein override the equivalent values in the base configuration
1. If any of these 3 configuration files are modified then 1-3 are run again

<Alert type='info'>

It it also supported for a module to have multiple configuration files
arranged into a folder hierarchy. In this case the configuration system is
directed to monitor for any changes in an entire folder. Once again, the
`Camera` module provides a good example of this. The same rules still apply,
however, rather than the "default file" needing to exist, the "default folder"
must exist. The merging rules will apply on a per-file basis whenever a change
to a file is detected in the folder that is being monitored.

</Alert>

<Alert type='info'>

A module can create multiple `Configuration` reactions, each one monitoring a different file or folder. The above detailed rules apply to each reaction individually.

</Alert>

## The Script System

The script system follows a similar structure as the configuration system. However, default scripts are moved to a platform type folder and the overriding system is not used as it doesn't make much sense to try and merge two scripts.

In the script system, we first check for a robot-specific script. If a robot-specific script does not exist, then we check for a platform-specific script.

```text
scripts/
├── nugus/
│   └── Stand.yaml
└── nugus2/
    └── Stand.yaml
```

To reiterate how the script system loads script files

1. A check is made to see if `config/RobotName/Script.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded
1. If it doesn't exist, then a check is made to see if `config/PlatformName/Script.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded
