## The Configuration System

The NUbots configuration system is based on a hierarchical [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file system.

The hierarchical structure is as follows

```text
config/
├── nugus1/
│   └── ExampleModule.yaml
├── nugus2/
│   └── ExampleModule.yaml
|   webots/
│   └── ExampleModule.yaml
├── robocup/
│   └── ExampleModule.yaml
└── ExampleModule.yaml
```

The file `config/ExampleModule.yaml` must exist for every module that uses configuration. This file defines all of the configuration for the module.
`config/webots/ExampleModule.yaml` is an optional file and allows you to provide platform-specific overrides for specific configuration values, in this case it would provide overrides for any webots robots. This is useful when webots and the real nugus robot use different configurations values.
`config/nugus1/ExampleModule.yaml` is an optional file and allows you to provide robot-specific overrides for specific configuration values, in this case it would provide overrides for the `nugus1` robot. It overrides the default and platform-specific configuration files.
Similarly, `config/robocup/ExampleModule.yaml` allows for the `robocup` role to further override configuration values. It overrides the default, platform-specific and robot-specific configuration files.

It is intended that all configuration values exist in the default configuration file and that only a subset of configuration values appear in the platform-specific, robot-specific and role-specific override files.

<Alert type='info'>

There are exceptions to this, the `Camera` module being the best example.

The `Camera` module introduces the `serial_number` field in the robot-specific
override files as every robot will have different cameras installed in it.
However, it makes no sense for the default configuration file to contain the
`serial_number` field as there is no viable default value for this field.

</Alert>

The platform-specific override is intended to allow for different configuration values between real robots and webots. For instance, the real NUgus robot uses a different Visual Mesh network compared to the robots run in the Webots simulator.

The robot-specific override is intended to allow configuration values to be tweaked to account a slight variation in the robots hardware. For instance, the cameras on each robot have different serial numbers.

The role-specific override is intended to change a modules behaviour based on which role is running. For instance, disabling the transmission of certain NUsight2 traffic while playing a competition game.

To reiterate how the configuration system loads and merges configuration files

1. The default configuration file `config/ModuleName.yaml` is loaded. This forms the base configuration for the module
2. A check is made to see if `config/PlatformName/ModuleName.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded and all values found therein override the equivalent values in the base configuration
3. A check is made to see if `config/RobotName/ModuleName.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded and all values found therein override the equivalent values in the base configuration
4. A check is made to see if `config/RoleName/ModuleName.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded and all values found therein override the equivalent values in the base configuration
5. If any of these 3 configuration files are modified then 1-4 are run again

<Alert type='info'>

It it also supported for a module to have multiple configuration files
arranged into a folder hierarchy. In this case the configuration system is
directed to monitor for any changes in an entire folder. Once again, the
`Camera` module provides a good example of this. The same rules still apply,
however, rather than the "default file" needing to exist, the "default folder"
must exist. The merging rules will apply on a per-file basis whenever a change
to a file is detected in the folder that is being monitored.

</Alert>

<Alert type='info'>

A module can create multiple `Configuration` reactions, each one monitoring a different file or folder. The above detailed rules apply to each reaction individually.

</Alert>

<Alert type='info'>

Robot platform is derivated from the hostname/robot name. The hostname of binaries run in Docker is `docker`, unless the binary being run contains the word `webots`. In this case, the hostname will be `webots`.

</Alert>

## The Script System

The script system works very much like the configuration system described above. However, default scripts are moved to a platform type folder and the merging of values is skipped as it doesn't make sense to try and merge two scripts.

In the script system, we first check for a robot-specific script. If a robot-specific script does not exist, then we check for a platform-specific script.

```text
scripts/
├── nugus/
│   └── Stand.yaml
└── nugus2/
    └── Stand.yaml
```

To reiterate how the script system loads script files

1. A check is made to see if `config/RobotName/Script.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded.
2. If it doesn't exist, a check is made to see if `config/PlatformName/Script.yaml` exists. If it does, it is loaded.

<Alert type='info'>

Robot platform is derivated from the hostname/robot name. The hostname of binaries run in Docker is `docker`, unless the binary being run contains the word `webots`. In this case, the hostname will be `webots`.
