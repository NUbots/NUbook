The NUbots repository is the main codebase that runs on the robots. Its purpose is to control the robot during RoboCup matches. The NUbots codebase, along with all other NUbots code, is open source and can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/). The primary language in the NUbots codebase is C++.

The main parts of the NUbots codebase are behaviour, motion, vision, and localisation. Behaviours include strategy, planning and skills. Motion includes kicking, getting up, and walking. Vision includes ball, goal and field detectors. Localisation determines where the robot, ball and the field are in the world through odometry.

At the top level, the robot will use strategy to decide what to do based on the game state. This includes unique behaviour for penalty shoot-outs.

The next level down is planning. This includes planning the path to walk along to get to the ball facing the right goal.
Below planning is skills. Skills include kicking, walking, getting up, and looking at objects.

Next is motions. Motions include how the robot moves its feet to walk, and what movements it does to kick or get up.

After motions is hardware IO. The hardware will output the commands and input the information from the world. This will then go through a sensor filter so that the robot can interpret the information. This information then influences strategy.

All these modules are connected using NUClear which is a message passing software architecture. More can be found on NUClear [here](https://nuclear.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Roles

The robot codebase contains roles, which are recipes for creating a binary to run on a robot. A role file lists all the modules to be used in that binary. Only modules included in the role file will run, provided the code is [triggered](/system/foundations/nuclear#nuclear-dsl). All roles can be found in the [roles folder](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/main/roles) in the first level of the repository and have the extension `.role`. For specifics about the NUClear roles system, see the [NUClear page](/system/foundations/nuclear#nuclear-roles).

When adding modules to the list in a role, use the syntax `path::to::module`. For example, if you want to include the [`DataLogging` module](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots/tree/main/module/support/logging/DataLogging), check the path to that module relative to the `module` folder. The path is `support/logging/DataLogging`, so we include the line `support::logging::DataLogging`.

The following is a table of roles that exist in the NUbots codebase and possible use cases for them.

| Role Name            | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `sensortest`         | Test odometry (needs NUsight). Check for broken servos without the robot moving, because servo errors and warnings will be printed to the terminal.                                                    |
| `visualmesh_fake`    | Test the vision system, such as detection of balls and goals, in a simulated environment.                                                                                                              |

In a role, you should have only one platform. Possible platforms are `platform::darwin::HardwareIO`, `platform::darwin::HardwareSimulator`, `platform::Webots` and `platform::Gazebo`.

Any code should run with `platform::darwin::HardwareSimulator`, but this is a very basic simulated robot and does not consider gravity - this may be useful if you want to see a motion run on the robot without the robot falling down, or if you want to test if the code runs without setting up the real robot or a simulator.

`platform::darwin::HardwareIO` is used for the real robot. You will get a runtime error if you do not run this on a robot, as it will be unable to find the hardware needed.

`platform::Webots` is used with the Webots simulator. The code will only run if an [appropriate Webots controller is running](/guides/tools/webots-setup).

`platform::Gazebo` is used with the Gazebo simulator. It will only work with the [appropriate Gazebo plugin](/guides/tools/gazebo-install).
