## FallingRelaxPlanner

### Description

The FallingRelaxPlanner module is used to detect when the robot is actively falling over and run a relax action to remove torque to the servos.
This is done to prevent damage when the robot impacts the ground, hopefully saving many gear set changes
The script to use for relaxing is configurable, for the case where simulations cannot handle the relax script and need something else, eg a stand script.

### Usage

Emit a `message::plan::RelaxWhenFalling` as a Task.
Make sure that it has a lower challenge priority than the GetUp, otherwise it may trigger in the middle of the getup resulting in an infinite loop of falling and half getting up.

### Consumes

- `message::input::Sensors` to determine when the robot is actively falling over
- `message::plan::RelaxWhenFalling` as a Task to activate this module allowing it to relax when the robot is falling over

### Emits

- `message::actuation::BodySequence` containing the script to use when relaxing

### Dependencies

- The Script extension

## GetUpPlanner

### Description

The GetUpPlanner module is used to automatically trigger a get up when the robot has fallen over.
It monitors the robot to see when it is lying down and has been relatively still for the past n frames before triggering a getup action.

### Usage

Emit a `message::plan::GetUpWhenFallen` as a Task.
Make sure that it has higher challenge priority than other recovery related tasks such as falling relax!
If relax has higher priority it may trigger mid getup

### Consumes

- `message::input::Sensors` to determine when the robot is in an appropriate state to get up
- `message::plan::GetUpWhenFallen` as a Task to activate this module to watch for when to run a getup

### Emits

- `message::skill::GetUp` as a task to trigger a get up action when appropriate

### Dependencies

- A module that can provide GetUp

## PlanKick

### Description

The module plans when to kick the ball, using information about the position of the ball relative to the robot and where the robot would like to kick to. It only uses recent ball measurements.

It checks

1. If the robot is close enough to the ball.
2. If the robot is facing the ball.
3. If the robot is facing the target to kick to.

If these checks pass, it will emit a Kick Task, specifying the leg to kick with based on which foot the ball is closer to.

There are configuration values that allow some flexibility with this method.

1. The third check can be skipped with the `align` configuration value.
2. A particular kick leg can be forced instead of checking the position using the `kick_leg` configuration value.

### Usage

Emit a KickTo Task with the position to kick to. The contents of the message (position to kick to) is not important if the `align` configuration value is set to `false`. The reaction requires localisation ball measurements.

### Consumes

- `message::planning::KickTo` a signal to kick the ball when conditions are met, with the location to kick the ball to in the message.
- `message::localisation::Ball` for information on where the ball is.

### Emits

- `message::skill::Kick` a signal to execute a kick movement, containing information on what leg to kick with.

### Dependencies

- The reaction will not run without localisation ball messages.

## PlanLook

### Description

Plans how to look around. Follows a search pattern to find objects.

### Usage

Add this module to your role to make the robot look around when requested.

### Consumes

- `message::planning::LookAround` a Task requesting to run the search pattern to look around

### Emits

- `message::skill::Look` a Task requesting to look in a direction
- `message::planning::LookAround` a Task requesting to run the search pattern to look around the environment

### Dependencies

## PlanWalkPath

### Description

Plans a walk path based on information given. Three types of walk path planning are in this module

1. Walking towards a particular point. This uses a point in robot space and walks to it, aligning with the direction to face at the target and avoiding robots.
   It avoids robots by finding the first robot that intersects with the path, grouping it with any close by robots, then walking to a spot to the left or right of the group.
   Once its cleared the group, it continues on to either avoid another robot or walk straight to the target
2. Turn on the spot. Without moving translationally, turn on the spot. Supports both directions.
3. Rotate around the ball. Rotate such that the ball stays in front of the robot, and the robot turns such that it changes the direction it is aligned towards. Supports both directions.

### Usage

Include this module in the role and emit the provide Task for either reaction. The reactions cannot run at the same time, since they both Need the Walk.

### Consumes

- `message::planning::WalkTo` Task requesting to walk towards a given point.
- `message::planning::TurnOnSpot` Task requesting to turn on the spot.
- `message::planning::PivotAroundPoint` Task requesting to rotate around the ball, to align with a direction.
- `message::localisation::Robots` to find any robots to avoid when path planning to a target.
- `message::input::Sensors` to transform robot points into (our own) robot space.

### Emits

- `message::skill::Walk` Task requesting to run the walk engine, giving the xy velocity (m/s) and rotational velocity (radians/s).

### Dependencies

- The walk engine
- Mathematics comparison utility
- Mathematics intersection utility
