## NetworkForwarder

### Description

This module forwards messages that are emitted in the system over NUClearNetwork.
Messages that are emitted are sent to the target when they are enabled in the configuration file.
The configuration file is able to set either `true` for a message type in which case it will attempt to send every single packet or you can set a number and it will rate limit that packet.

The forwarder will split messages rate limiting by an id field if they have one

### Emits

Network emits every message that is in the configuration over NUClearNet to the target

## NUClearNet

This module is responsible for connecting the system to the NUClear Network.
In the configuration you must set a name, broadcast address and port.
By setting these three the network will connect and be able to communicate with other NUClearNet systems that are on the same network.

### Name

If the name is left as an empty string in the configuration, the system will use the current host name as the name of the NUClearNet node.

### Address

The NUClearNet system can take an IP address or a dns name as the address. The address is able to resolve to either IPv4 or IPv6 address.
There are three main ways you can configure the network and use it.

#### Unicast Mode

In Unicast mode, you connect from this device to another device on a specific other system. This address may also be `127.0.0.1` if you wish to only connect to other NUClearNet binaries on the same system.
In Unicast mode, you set the IP address here to the IP address of the other system you wish to connect to and on that system set the IP address of this system.
This form of networking is useful when you are debugging and wish to make a small isolated NUClearNet system.

#### Broadcast Mode

In broadcast mode, you set the address to the broadcast IP of your network (e.g. `192.168.1.255` for the network `192.168.1.0/24`). In this mode you will connect to all other systems that are running on that same network. In general you should prefer multicast mode over this mode so that you only send packets to systems that are specifically part of the NUClearNet node rather than sending to all computers on the network and using up the bandwidth.

#### Multicast Mode

In multicast mode you set either an IPv4 or IPv6 multicast address. Then provided your network correctly routes multicast packets it will connect to all other NUClearNet nodes that share the same multicast address. The default address for this is `239.226.152.162`

### Port

The default port for NUClearNet is 7447. You can use different ports if you want to make several distinct NUClearNet networks on the same device.

## PlotJuggler

### Description

This module allows for sending data from NUbots to [PlotJuggler](https://www.plotjuggler.io) for plotting in real time. It does this by listening for `DataPoint` messages (what we use for plotting in NUsight), transforming them to a suitable format and sending them to PlotJuggler via UDP.

### Usage

To plot data from a role you're working on using PlotJuggler, do the following.

1. [Download and install PlotJuggler](https://github.com/facontidavide/PlotJuggler#installation).
2. Launch PlotJuggler and start the UDP server.

   ![Screenshot of PlotJuggler showing UDP server details](images/plotjuggler-udp-server.jpg)

   A. Under the **Streaming** section at the left of the PlotJuggler UI, select "UDP Server" and click "Start".

   B. In the window that pops up, enter a port, select "JSON" for **Message Protocol**, and check the box to use the timestamp field if available. Take note of the port and click "OK".

3. Add the `network::PlotJuggler` module to the role you're working on.
4. Update the `PlotJuggler.yaml` config file.

   - Set `forward_datapoints` to true to enable forwarding of data to PlotJuggler.
   - Under `udp_server`, set `ip_address` and `port` to the UDP server details from PlotJuggler. `ip_address` should be the address of the computer running PlotJuggler, or `127.0.0.1` if you're running PlotJuggler on the same computer as the role binary.

5. In your role, anywhere you want to plot data:

   - Include the `graph()` helper:

     ```cpp
     // In the includes section
     #include "utility/nusight/NUhelpers.hpp"

     // In the module namespace, to use `graph()` without specifying the namespace prefix every time
     using utility::nusight::graph;
     ```

   - Call `graph()` with the label and values you want to plot, and `emit()` the result:

     ```cpp
     // Plotting a single value
     emit(graph("Distance to ball", distance_to_ball));

     // 2-4 values will be labelled "x", "y", "z", "w" automatically
     emit(graph("Gyro", my_gyro_data.x(), my_gyro_data.y(), my_gyro_data.z()));

     // 5 or more values will be labelled "s0", "s1", "s2", ..., "s[n-1]" automatically
     emit(graph("My data", s0, s1, s2, s3, s4));
     ```

6. Build and run your role
7. Data should start appearing in the PlotJuggler sidebar when the role is running. To plot a data point, drag its label from the sidebar to the graph space at the right.

> **Note**
> If you're not seeing data in PlotJuggler, double check that the UDP server is running, `PlotJuggler.yaml` has the right configuration, and your role is sending data. You can also set the `send_debug_waves` config option to `true` to send sample data to PlotJuggler to test the connection.

### Consumes

- `message::eye::DataPoint` - listens for these from the rest of the codebase, transforming and forwarding them to PlotJuggler

### Emits

- `message::eye::DataPoint` - when debug waves are enabled for testing the connection to PlotJuggler
- JSON-formatted packets to PlotJuggler via UDP

### Dependencies

- JSON for modern C++ library

## RobotCommunication

### Description

This module adds a communication schema that conforms to the official
robocup spec. It allows the robots to use this schema for internal communication.

The Robocup message is created, and emitted to other robots over UDP. All UDP messages are received by every robot in the network.

UDP messages that have been emitted by the receiving robot are filtered out.

The information that has been received over UDP is then emitted locally.

### Usage

Add this module to get information about other robots.

### Consumes

- `message::input::RoboCup` which contains data about the robot, including its state, current position, projected position and its view of the other robots.
- `message::behaviour::state::WalkState` which contains data about the robot's current movement.
- `message::input::GameState` which contains the current state of the game and penalised robots.
- `message::input::Sensors` which contains data from the robot's sensors, used to calculate its world position.
- `message::localisation::Ball` which contains information about the estimated position and velocity of the ball
- `message::localisation::Field` which contains information to convert values from world to field space
- `message::skill::Kick` which contains the direction and target of the robot's kick

### Emits

- `message::input::RoboCup` via UDP.
- `message::input::RoboCup` via local.

### Dependencies

- [Eigen Linear Algebra Library](https://libeigen.gitlab.io/eigen/docs-nightly/)
