## Camera

### Description

Reads Cameras: Which are GigE Vision or U3V (Usb3 Vision, via USB3 Cable).

### Usage

Settings are defined in the `config/Cameras`

### Emits

`message::input::Image`

### Dependencies

Aravis

## FakeCamera

### Description

Loads compressed images (JPEGs) and corresponding lens parameters (YAML files) from the specified folder and emits them as `CompressedImage` messages

Images are and lens files are expected to be named using a common theme (e.g. image000001.jpg and lens000001.yaml).

### Usage

In the config file set `image_folder` to be the path to the folder containing the image and lens files, `image_prefix` to the portion of the filename that is common to all image files and `lens_prefix` to the portion of the filename that is common to all lens files.

```yaml
image_folder: 'images'
image_prefix: 'image'
lens_prefix: 'lens'
```

All images are assumed to be JPEGs with either a `.jpg` or `.jpeg` extension. All lens files are assumed to be YAML files with a `.yaml` extension.

Lens files should contain the following information

```yaml
projection: EQUISOLID # Either RECTILINEAR, EQUIDUSTANT, or EQUISOLID
focal_length: 420 # Un-normalised focal length in pixels
centre: [0, 0] # Distance between the camera centre axis and optical axis in pixels (measured from the centre of the image)
k: [0, 0] # Distortion coefficients
fov: 1.59286 # Field of view in radians
Hoc: # Camera to observation plane (world) homogeneous transformation
  - [-0.308872, 0.945477, 0.103304, 0]
  - [-0.84664, -0.223831, -0.482805, 0]
  - [-0.433359, -0.236586, 0.869613, 0.9]
  - [0, 0, 0, 1]
```

### Emits

`message::output::CompressedImage` with a `JPEG` FOURCC code

### Dependencies

Eigen
libjpeg-turbo

## ImageDecompressor

### Description

Decompresses images that are in JPEG format to raw images, using a variety of decompressors.
It will use decompressors in order until it finds a free one to compress the image.
In the event that no compressors are currently free it will drop the image.

### Usage

Triggers on `message::output::CompressedImage`
Configuration from `ImageDecompressor.yaml`

### Emits

`message::input::Image`

### Dependencies

TurboJPEG

## Sensor Filter

### Description

Uses a Unscented Kalman filter to filter the raw incoming data, and provide clean platform agnostic data.

We assume that the IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) are oriented to conform with the standard coordinate system x-axis out
the front of the robot y-axis to the left z-axis up

For the accelerometer the orientation should be as follows
x axis reports a +1g acceleration when robot is laying on its back
y axis reports a +1g acceleration when robot is laying on its right side
z axis reports a +1g acceleration when robot is vertical

### Usage

When installed, it will read incoming `message::platform::RawSensors` objects and pass them through the kalman filter.
The resulting filtered data will then be outputted as `message::input::Sensors` to be used by the rest of the system.

### Consumes

- `message::platform::RawSensors` in order to filter them.

### Emits

- `message::input::Sensors` with filtered data from the input.
- `message::input::ButtonLeftDown` when button pressed.
- `message::input::ButtonLeftUp` when button released.
- `message::input::ButtonMiddleDown` when button pressed.
- `message::input::ButtonMiddleUp` when button released.
- `message::eye::DataPoint` if log_level >= DEBUG, indicating if feet are down.
