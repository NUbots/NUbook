## AllRounder

### Description

Play soccer in the all rounder position, which is a multi-purpose position for when only one robot is active. Either bypass GameController and force play, or uses GameController information to decide what to do.

In the ready state, makes a Ready subtask.

In the playing state (for both normal game mode and penalty shootout), finds the ball, fixates on the ball, walks to the ball, and kicks the ball.

In other states, stands still.

### Usage

## Script Runner

### Description

Allows scripts to be run from the command line.

### Usage

the first script has completed it will run the next, and so on until all are
finished at which point it terminates the program.

### Dependencies

## Script Tuner

### Description

Provides a curses interface for creating, editing and tweaking scripts.

The program must be started with the name of a script file to edit as its sole
command line argument. If the file does not exist then a new blank script is
started and the file will be created when it is saved.

The keyboard controls are as follows:

- Up/Down arrow: Select servo
- Left/right arrow: Select angle or gain
- , (comma): Go to previous frame
- . (period): Go to next frame
- Enter: Edit selected field
- Space: Toggle motor lock
- : (colon): List available commands
- A: Save script as
- G: Allows multiple gain edits at once
- I: Delete current frame
- J: "jump" to frame without the robot moving
- M: Mirror script - flip about sagittal plane
- N: Insert a new frame before the current frame
- R: Refresh the view
- S: Save script
- T: edit frame duration
- X: Shutdown powerplant/stop binary

### Consumes

- `NUClear::message::CommandLineArguments` containing the name of the script to edit
- `module::behaviour::tools::LockServo` (internal to this class only) to trigger servo lock event
- `message::platform::RawSensors` to get position of specific servo when locking it

### Emits

- `message::actuation::ServoTarget` to control currently selected servo when locked or unlocked
- `message::actuation::ServoTargets` to control all servos when transitioning between frames
- `message::actuation::LimbsSequence` to play the script
- `module::behaviour::tools::LockServo` (internal to this class only) to trigger servo lock event

### Dependencies

- libncurses is used for the user interface

## Soccer

### Description

Starts the Director graph for the soccer scenario. If the robot is penalised, it will make it stand still. Otherwise, it will emit the Task corresponding to the soccer position specified in configuration.

If the configuration is set to "dynamic" it will choose the appropriate position out of Defender and Striker. The robot listens for the positions of other robots and makes its decision.

Possible positions are Striker, Goalie and Defender.

- `message::input::Sensors` to transform the ball from world to robot space
- `message::input::GameEvents::Penalisation` to find out if the robot has been penalised and should stop moving
- `message::input::GameEvents::Unpenalisation` to find out if the robot has been unpenalised and can play again
- `message::input::ButtonMiddleDown` to force play with a middle button press

### Emits

- `message::purpose::FindPurpose` a Task to request to find the robot's soccer playing purpose, to start the Director graph to play soccer
- `message::purpose::Purposes` to inform the other robots of their purposes
- `message::strategy::StandStill` to make the robot still while penalised
- `message::platform::ResetWebotsServos` to reset the servos in Webots when penalised

- `message::purpose::Striker` a Task to request the robot acts as a striker
- `message::purpose::Goalie` a Task to request the robot acts as a goalie
- `message::purpose::Defender` a Task to request the robot acts as a defender

### Dependencies

## Striker

### Description

Play soccer in the striker position, which is an offensive position. Either bypass GameController and force play, or uses GameController information to decide what to do.

In the ready state, makes a Ready subtask.

In the playing state (for both normal game mode and penalty shootout), finds the ball, fixates on the ball, walks to the ball, and kicks the ball. It will not approach the ball if it is not in its own bounding box, and instead will stand nearby.

In other states, stands still.
