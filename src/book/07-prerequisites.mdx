## NUbots

Linux is highly recommended for running NUbots code. You can find free downloads for [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) online.

Next you need to get the GitHub repository onto your computer. In Linux, to do this open a console. The following commands will install git and clone the repository.

```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots.git
```

Now that the repository is on your computer, install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and Virtualbox.

```bash
sudo apt install virtualbox-dkms
sudo dpkg -i vagrant_X.Y.Z_x86_64.deb
```

Next download your favourite text editing program. We recommend [sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/linux_repositories.html#apt) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). NUbots also requires correct formatting which can be provided automatically by [clang-format](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clang%20Format). This requires a recent version of clang-format to be installed, and setting up an apt repo is recommended. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) is a useful GUI for GitHub repositories, or you can use Git in the console.

## NUsight

If you want to use the debugging tool, NUsight, then there are some things to do first. Open a new console and enter:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NUbots/NUsight2/
```

The NUsight repository will now be cloned to your computer. Next enter:

```bash
cd NUsight2
```

Next you will need to install some dependencies. These are [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#debian-stable) and [Node.js](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-18.04/). Once these are installed, you are ready to use NUsight.
