## Common Issues

**Multiple Docker robots in NUsight?**

This means someone else is also running a Docker robot. You can modify the name of your Docker robot by doing the following.

```bash
nano module/support/configuration/NetworkConfiguration/data/config/NetworkConfiguration.yaml
```

Write in the name you want to use in the `name: ""` section and press `CTRL+O` to write to the file and then `CTRL+X` to exit.

Rebuild using `./b build` for the changes to take effect.

In NUsight, toggle off the robots you do not want to see by clicking the robot icon in the top right of the NUsight GUI and toggling the slider next to the name of the robot you want to toggle off.

**Not enough memory in Docker? (Mac OS)**

By default the docker install will allocate 2GB of memory to docker images. When building the images this is insufficent for some of the libraries and will result in an error. In the menu bar go to advanced settings and increase the memory available.
