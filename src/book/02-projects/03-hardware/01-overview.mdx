The NUbots team uses the NUgus hardware platform, a modification of the [igus® Humanoid Open Platform](http://www.nimbro.net/OP/). The NUgus robots are 3D printed using fused deposition modelling.

## igus® Modifications

The following modifications were made to fit our specific requirements:

- The components of the robot were split to to fit the size of the printer bed and volume.
- The torso was modified to have open shoulder covers for shoulder servo cable access.

## Servos

The arms and head of the NUgus robot use [MX64AR servos from Dynamixel](http://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-mx-64ar/), with two in each shoulder, one in each elbow, and two in the neck. The legs use [MX106 servos from Dynamixel](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/actuator/dynamixel/mx_series/mx-106.htm), with two in each ankle, three in each hip, and one in each knee.

## Cameras

The NUgus robot uses two [FLIR Blackfly S](https://flir.app.boxcn.net/s/x0r0bdsjstdkudjd2dwlxoa5fdvj2gpg/file/418603726810) USB3 cameras with a C-Mount lens positioned in their head, producing images at 170FPS. Two custom-built S-Mount to C-Mount lens adaptors are used to attach two [Lensation 180° fisheye S-Mount lenses](https://www.lensation.de/product/BF10M19828S118C/). Two [20" USB3 micro USB to up angle USB A cables](https://www.angledcables.com/up-angle-a2.html) are used to connect the cameras to the robot's computer.

## Computing

The NUgus robot uses the [Intel NUC7i7bnh](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/95065/intel-nuc-kit-nuc7i7bnh.html) NUC with a [Silverstone NT07-115X](https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=442&area=en) cooling fan. It has 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a [Robotis CM740 Sub Controller](<http://support.robotis.com/en/product/robotis-op2/sub_controller(cm-740).htm>).

## Networking

The NUgus robot has an Ethernet port as well as WiFi capability. It has two custom-ordered 15cm MHF.4 to RP-SMA wireless antenna cables from the [RFShop](https://rfshop.com.au/), with two RP-SMA antennas which are around 1" long.

## Power

The NUgus robot uses a 3850mAh 4s LiPo battery when not plugged into power. It uses a rebuilt Darwin power board and a custom 16A cylindrical fuse holder. The NUC power board which distributes power to the cooling fan and the NUC is also custom.
