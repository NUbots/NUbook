The platform used is the NUgus, based off the [igusÂ® Humanoid Open Platform](http://www.nimbro.net/OP/). The NUgus robots are 3D printed using fused deposition modelling. Because of this, the components of the robot were split to allow for the size of the printer bed and the printer volume. The torso was also modified to have open shoulder covers for shoulder servo cable access.

## Servos

The arms and head of the NUgus robot use [MX64AR servos from Dynamixel](http://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-mx-64ar/), with two in each shoulder, one in each elbow, and two in the neck. The legs use [MX106 servos from Dynamixel](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/actuator/dynamixel/mx_series/mx-106.htm), with two in each ankle, three in each hip, and one in each knee.

## Cameras

The robots use two [FLIR Blackfly S](https://flir.app.boxcn.net/s/x0r0bdsjstdkudjd2dwlxoa5fdvj2gpg/file/418603726810) USB3 cameras with a C-Mount lens positioned in their head, giving 170FPS. Two custom build S-Mount to C-Mount lens adaptors are used to attach two [Lensation 180$^\circ$ fisheye S-Mount lenses](https://www.lensation.de/product/BF10M19828S118C/). Two [20" USB3 micro USB to up angle USB A cables](https://www.angledcables.com/up-angle-a2.html) are used to connect the cameras to the robot's computer.

## Computing

The NUgus uses an Intel NUC7i7bnh with a Silverstone NT07-115X cooling fan. It has 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, and a Robotis CM740 Subcontroller.

## WiFi

The robot has an Ethernet port as well as WiFi capability. It has two custom order 15cm MHF.4 to RP-SMA wireless antenna cables from the [RFShop](https://rfshop.com.au/), with two RP-SMA antennas which are around 1" long.

## Power

The robot uses a 3850mAh 4s LiPo battery when not plugged into power. The NUgus uses a rebuilt Darwin power board and a custom 16A cylindrical fuse holder. It uses a custom NUC power board, which distributes power to the cooling fan and the NUC.
