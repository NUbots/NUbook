# Graphs and Diagrams

## Using circo layout

The following code in Markdown:

````md
```circo
# A graph showing the dependencies in the system
# Drawn using GraphViz with circo layout
digraph {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> D;
}
```
````

Produces the following graph:

```circo
# A graph showing the dependencies in the system
# Drawn using GraphViz with circo layout
digraph {
    A -> B [label="AB"];
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> D;
}
```

## Using dot layout

The following code in Markdown:

````md
```dot
# A graph showing the dependencies in the system
# Drawn using GraphViz with dot layout
digraph {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> G -> D;
}
```
````

Produces the following graph:

```dot
# A graph showing the dependencies in the system
# Drawn using GraphViz with dot layout
digraph {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> G -> D;
}
```

## Using fdp layout

The following code in Markdown:

````md
```fdp
# A graph showing the dependencies in the system
# Drawn using GraphViz with fdp layout
digraph {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> D;
}
```
````

Produces the following graph:

```fdp
# A graph showing the dependencies in the system
# Drawn using GraphViz with fdp layout
digraph {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> D;
}
```

    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> D;
}
```
````

Produces the following graph:

```neato
# A graph showing the dependencies in the system
# Drawn using GraphViz with neato layout
digraph {
    A -> B;
    B -> C;
    C -> D;
    D -> A;
    D -> E -> F -> G -> D;
}
```
