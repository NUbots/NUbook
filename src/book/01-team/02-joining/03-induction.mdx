The NUbots lab induction can be found [here](./docs/lab-induction.pdf). All new members must complete the lab induction as well as the [SEEC induction](https://www-eng.newcastle.edu.au/eecs/ect/oh&s/Lab%20Access/LabInductions.html). These must be completed for you to be allowed in the lab unsupervised. Completing these inductions will enable you to be eligible for swipe card access to the NUbots lab.

The NUbots lab induction is an in-person induction done with the Team Leader or Team Safety Officer. The SEEC induction is an online induction done through Blackboard. You do not need to do the SEEC induction again if you did it within the last year. If you have not done it, let the Team Leader know so that they can get you access to the Blackboard course site to complete it.
