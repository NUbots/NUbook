The NUbots development process is a combination of in-person and remote collaboration, supported by online collaboration tools.

## Meetings and Lab Work

We hold weekly meetings in our lab at [ES115A](https://studentvip.com.au/newcastle/newcastle/maps/99668) on the University of Newcastle's Callaghan Campus. We currently meet on **Wednesdays from 3-4pm**.

Feel free to come to any one of our meetings if you're interested in joining the team and want to see how we work.

Team members also have dedicated work spaces in the lab where they work at various times during the week.

## Online Communication

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/) for team communication. You will be invited to our Slack workspace when you join the team.

## Development

We use GitHub for development and code collaboration. All NUbots code can be found on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/NUbots/).

The main repositories are:

- [NUbots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots) - the C++ codebase that runs on the robots
- [NUsight2](https://github.com/NUbots/NUsight2) - the visual real-time web-based debugging environment we used to understand and improve our systems

To contribute code to NUbots, you will need to create a GitHub account. You will be added to the GitHub organisation when you [join the team](/team/how-to-join).
