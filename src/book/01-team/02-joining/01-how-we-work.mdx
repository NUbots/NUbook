The NUbots development process is a combination of in-person and remote collaboration, supported by online collaboration tools.

## Meetings and Lab Work

We hold weekly meetings on Zoom at **Friday from 1-2pm**. This time may change based on team members' availabilities.

Team members have dedicated work spaces in the lab where they work at various times during the week.

## Online Communication

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-au/) for team communication. You will be invited to our Slack workspace when you join the team.

## Development

We use GitHub for development and code collaboration. All NUbots code can be found on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/NUbots/).

The main repositories are:

- [NUbots](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbots) - monorepo with the C++ codebase that runs on the robots, and NUsight, the web-based debugging environment we used to understand and improve our systems.
- [NUbook](https://github.com/NUbots/NUbook) - our team handbook, which you are viewing now! Built with Gatsby and deployed using Netlify.

To contribute code to NUbots, you will need to create a GitHub account. You will be added to the GitHub organisation when you [join the team](/team/how-to-join).
