## Benefits of Joining

Joining NUbots is a great educational experience that also benefits your career. You will gain valuable real-world experience working on a team, and improve your research and development skills by putting what you've learned at university to practical use.

NUbots makes a great addition to your CV, and where possible, you get the opportunity to travel internationally to represent the University of Newcastle at the annual [RoboCup](/team/robocup) competition.

## Ways to Join

If you are interested in joining NUbots, there are a few ways to get involved.

- One way is to join during our **official recruitment** period. Every year during Semester 2 we announce recruitment and provide a link to our application form, on Blackboard and on the [NUbots Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/NubotsRobotics/).

- Another way to join is to **come and talk to us** in the lab about your areas of interest and what you would like to do. We are located in the ES building on the Callaghan campus, at [ES115A](https://studentvip.com.au/newcastle/newcastle/maps/99668).

- You can also join NUbots **through your studies**. We offer research projects for students doing Work Integrated Learning, industrial experience, Honours, Final Year Project, Masters, or PhD. See our [areas of research](/team/areas-of-research) for a list of research areas we offer.

## The Onboarding Process

All new recruits go through a short interview process where we get to know your background and areas of interest. You then go through the [lab induction](/team/induction) process. After that, we work together with you to come up with a small starter project. We then assign you a mentor to provide support and help you get started on your project.

We are always looking for new members, so if you are interested, come visit us in the lab and introduce yourself!
