If you are interested in joining NUbots, there are a few ways to get involved. One way is to join through our official recruitment. Every year during semester 2 there is an application that can be found on our Facebook page and on Blackboard.

Another way to join is to come visit us in the lab. We are located in the ES building in the Engineering Precinct on Callaghan campus, UON, at ES115a. Let us know that you’re interested in joining and what research area/s you’re interested in and we can find you something to work on.

NUbots offers also research projects for students to do for Work Integrated Learning, industrial experience, Honours, Final Year Project, Masters, or PhD.

We are always looking for new members, so if you are interested then please come visit us in the lab and introduce yourself!
