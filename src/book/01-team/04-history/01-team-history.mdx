NUbots have competed in RoboCup every year since 2002.

NUbots have competed in the Four Legged League (2002-2007), the Standard Platform League (2008-2011), the Humanoid KidSize League (2012-2017) and the Humanoid TeenSize League (2018-2019).

NUbots became the Four Legged League world champions in 2006 in Germany. NUbots, in collaboration with the National University of Maynooth from Ireland, won the first Standard Platform League in 2008, as team NUManoid in Suzhou, China.

## 2021: Online

RoboCup went online in 2021 for all leagues, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. NUbots participated in the Humanoid KidSize League, which was held using the [Webots simulator by Cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com/).

**Major hardware changes**

Because the competition was run virtually in simulation, there were no hardware changes. A robot model with touch sensors on the feet was created for use in the competition.

**Major software changes**

- Support for Webots
- Major fix/improvement of the Unscented Kalman Filter used for odometry
- Creation of new particle filter for localisation
