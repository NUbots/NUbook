**Performance and Results**

NUbots placed 9th in the drop-in games with an average of -3.4 points across five games. A total of 12 teams were in the competition.

NUbots placed second in their first round robin group, with a winning goal against UTRA from Canada.

| Rank | Team        | Points | Played | Won | Drew | Lost |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ | ------ | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    | Rhoban FC   | 9      | 3      | 3   | 0    | 0    |
| 2    | NUbots      | 4      | 3      | 1   | 1    | 1    |
| 3    | Bold Hearts | 2      | 3      | 0   | 2    | 1    |
| 4    | UTRA        | 1      | 3      | 0   | 1    | 2    |

With this result, NUbots progressed to the second round robin directly without having to play in an intermediate game.

NUbots placed third in their second round robin group, drawing against Hamburg Bit-Bots from Germany and losing to a goal by TH-MOS from China.

| Rank | Team             | Points | Played | Won | Drew | Lost |
| ---- | ---------------- | ------ | ------ | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 1    | TH-MOS           | 4      | 2      | 1   | 1    | 0    |
| 2    | Hamburg Bit-Bots | 2      | 2      | 0   | 2    | 0    |
| 3    | NUbots           | 1      | 2      | 0   | 1    | 1    |

With this unfortunate result, NUbots did not progress to the quarter-finals. The team was close to scoring a goal in both games, but small bugs and issues with the ability of the robots to get up from a fall meant that the team was unable to score. TH-MOS progressed to the semi-finals, where they placed fourth.

Rhoban FC won the competition, with CIT Brains placing second and Barelang FC placing third.

The team made major progress in this competition, with the team scoring a winning goal in a normal game scenario for the first time in seven years. Major software and hardware upgrades made this possible.

## 2022: Bangkok, Thailand

RoboCup Bangkok was the first in-person RoboCup in three years. All but one team member had never attended an in-person RoboCup competition before. No team members had attended an overseas RoboCup competition. The team faced further issues when the majority of the luggage did not arrive until the end of the first competition day.

**Major hardware changes**

- Robots upgraded from 3D printed legs to aluminium legs
- New padding and colours

**Major software changes**

- New head behaviour that fixates on the ball and moves in a predefined motion if no ball is found
- New walk path planner that moves the robot to the ball
- Get up fixes, got working on the real robot

**Performance and Results**

NUbots placed last (11th) in the drop-in games because the team did not have any robots to play with due to missing luggage.

The team had a specially arranged robot inspection at 8.15am on the second competition day and were able to enter the round robin at 11am that day. The team placed second in their round robin group, made up of RO-BIT and ITAndroids. In the intermediate game that followed, the team won in a penalty shootout. This sent the team to the quarter-finals, where they lost to CIT Brains, who won the competition.

NUbots made it to the quarter-finals of the competition. Overall the team played 4 games, won 1, drew 2, and lost 1.
