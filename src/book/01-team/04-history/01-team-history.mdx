NUbots have competed in RoboCup every year since 2002.

NUbots have competed in the Four Legged League (2002-2007), the Standard Platform League (2008-2011), the Humanoid KidSize League (2012-2017, 2021-2022) and the Humanoid TeenSize League (2018-2019).

NUbots became the Four Legged League world champions in 2006 in Germany. NUbots, in collaboration with the National University of Maynooth from Ireland, won the first Standard Platform League in 2008, as team NUManoid in Suzhou, China.

## 2022: Bangkok, Thailand

RoboCup Bangkok was the first in-person RoboCup in three years. All but one team member had never attended an in-person RoboCup competition before. No team members had attended an overseas RoboCup competition. The team faced further issues when the majority of the luggage did not arrive until the end of the first competition day.

**Major hardware changes**

- Robots upgraded from 3D printed legs to aluminium legs
- New padding and colours

**Major software changes**

- First time using the Quintic Walk engine in an in-person RoboCup
- Newly trained Visual Mesh with robots and fine-tuned on the Bangkok RoboCup field
- Variety of robots in NUpbr
- New, simpler behaviour using vision balls
- New head behaviour that fixates on the ball and moves in a predefined motion if no ball is found
- New walk path planner that moves the robot to the ball
- Get up fixes, got working on the real robot

**Performance and Results**

NUbots placed last (11th) in the drop-in games because the team did not have any robots to play with due to missing luggage.

The team had a specially arranged robot inspection at 8.15am on the second competition day and were able to enter the round robin at 11am that day. The team placed second in their round robin group, made up of RO-BIT and ITAndroids. In the intermediate game that followed, the team won in a penalty shootout. This sent the team to the quarter-finals, where they lost to CIT Brains, who won the competition.

NUbots made it to the quarter-finals of the competition. Overall the team played 4 games, won 1, drew 2, and lost 1.

## 2021/2022 Virtual Season

After the effort of creating the online competition format using Webots in 2021, the League decided to make use of this work by starting the [Virtual Season competition](https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-vs2022/). The competition was designed to span over several months, with the first game on the 19th of December 2021, and the final games on the 17th of April 2022.

The Virtual Season included a free three-day workshop following the final games. The workshop had a focus on sim2real and included talks from the 3D Simulation League, team presentations and additional workshops on tools for Webots. [The sessions were recorded for future viewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXeeDL_LV4o&list=PLgdIO6u3RLU_LgntQKIHiZrF3S3sN1vcT).

**Major hardware changes**

There was no change to the robot model.

**Major software changes**

- Webots vision data collection update
- Retrained the Visual Mesh with data from the updated data collection tool

**Performance and Results**

NUbots were knocked out in the Quarterfinals by 01. RFC Berlin.

## Brazil Open 2021

[The Brazil Open](https://www.cbrobotica.org/) was held online due to COVID-19 with the same setup from RoboCup 2021, allowing the NUbots team to participate.

**Major hardware changes**

There was no change to the robot model. The competition restricted teams to one robot.

**Major software changes**

- Fixed the robot freezing issue from RoboCup 2021
- Improved behaviour resulting in the robot more consistently walking to the ball

**Performance and Results**

The competition involved a round robin, with the winners decided based on game won and goals scored.

| Goals (Own/Against) | Played | Won | Drew | Lost |
| ------------------- | ------ | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 2 - 21              | 7      | 0   | 5    | 2    |

## 2021: Online

RoboCup went online in 2021 for all leagues, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. NUbots participated in the Humanoid KidSize League, which was held using the [Webots simulator by Cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com/).

**Major hardware changes**

Because the competition was run virtually in simulation, there were no hardware changes. A robot model with touch sensors on the feet was created for use in the competition.

**Major software changes**

- Support for Webots
- Major fix/improvement of the Unscented Kalman Filter used for odometry
- Creation of new particle filter for localisation
- Implementation of new walk engine, the Quintic Walk from team Bit-Bots.
- Visual Mesh v2
- NUsight odometry view

**Performance and Results**

NUbots made it to the quarter-finals of the competition. Overall we played 5 games, won 1, drew 2 and lost 2.

- New Git repository, moved away from CVS
- Introduction of threading for NAOs, (SeeThinkThread: 30Hz, SenseMoveThread: 100Hz)

- Soft colour classifications: starting using a transition colour, that can belong in different categories of objects, that is assigned an object with context at a later stage in the processing pipeline.
- Advances in Line Detection, with the introduction of corner point (L and T shapes), penalty spot, and center circle detection (ellipse fitting).
- Improvements in Localisation as a direct result of the additional field objects seen.
- Multiple model extended Kalman Filter
