NUbots have competed in RoboCup every year since 2002.

NUbots have competed in the Four Legged League (2002-2007), the Standard Platform League (2008-2011), the Humanoid KidSize League (2012-2017) and the Humanoid TeenSize League (2018-2019).

NUbots became the Four Legged League world champions in 2006 in Germany. NUbots, in collaboration with the National University of Maynooth from Ireland, won the first Standard Platform League in 2008, as team NUManoid in Suzhou, China.

## 2021/2022 Virtual Season

After the effort of creating the online competition set up in Webots for 2021, the League decided to make use of this work by starting the [Virtual Season competition](https://humanoid.robocup.org/hl-vs2022/). The competition was designed to span over many months, with the first game on the 19th of December, 2021, and the final games on the 17th of April, 2022.

The Virtual Season included a free three-day workshop following the final games. The workshop had a focus on sim2real and included talks from the 3D Simulation League, team presentations and additional workshops on tools for Webots. [The sessions were recorded for future viewing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXeeDL_LV4o&list=PLgdIO6u3RLU_LgntQKIHiZrF3S3sN1vcT).

**Major hardware changes**

There was no change to the robot model.

**Major software changes**

- Webots vision data collection update
- Retrained the Visual Mesh with data from the updated data collection tool

**Performance and Results**

NUbots were knocked out in the Quarterfinals by 01. RFC Berlin.

## Brazil Open 2021

[The Brazil Open](https://www.cbrobotica.org/) was held online due to COVID-19 with the same setup from RoboCup 2021, allowing the NUbots team to participate.

**Major hardware changes**

There was no change to the robot model. The competition restricted teams to one robot.

**Major software changes**

- Fixed the robot freezing issue from RoboCup 2021
- Improved behaviour resulting in the robot more consistently walking to the ball

**Performance and Results**

The competition involved a round robin, with the winners decided based on game won and goals scored.

| Goals (Own/Against) | Played | Won | Drew | Lost |
| ------------------- | ------ | --- | ---- | ---- |
| 2 - 21              | 7      | 0   | 5    | 2    |

## 2021: Online

RoboCup went online in 2021 for all leagues, due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. NUbots participated in the Humanoid KidSize League, which was held using the [Webots simulator by Cyberbotics](https://cyberbotics.com/).

**Major hardware changes**

Because the competition was run virtually in simulation, there were no hardware changes. A robot model with touch sensors on the feet was created for use in the competition.

**Major software changes**

- Support for Webots
- Major fix/improvement of the Unscented Kalman Filter used for odometry
- Creation of new particle filter for localisation
- Implementation of new walk engine, the Quintic Walk from team Bit-Bots.
- Visual Mesh v2
- NUsight odometry view

**Performance and Results**

NUbots made it to the quarter-finals of the competition. Overall we played 5 games, won 1, drew 2 and lost 2.

## 2020: Bordeaux, France (cancelled)

The 2020 RoboCup competition was scheduled to occur in the city of Bordeaux in France in June. This was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, but then cancelled early 2021 due to the ongoing pandemic.

## 2019: Sydney, Australia

RoboCup 2019 was held in Sydney, Australia.

**Major hardware changes**

- Upgraded from CM730 motor controller and IMU to the CM740.
- Upgraded cameras from FLIR Flea3 to FLIR Blackfly S.

**Major software changes**

- Changed from lookup table-based vision with a single-class visual mesh to a multi-class visual mesh for vision.
- Added localisation, chart, vision and visual mesh display to NUsight2.

**Performance and Results**

NUbots made it to the quarter-finals of the competition. Overall we played 13 games, won 5, drew 2, and lost 6.

- Soft colour classifications: starting using a transition colour, that can belong in different categories of objects, that is assigned an object with context at a later stage in the processing pipeline.
- Advances in Line Detection, with the introduction of corner point (L and T shapes), penalty spot, and center circle detection (ellipse fitting).
- Improvements in Localisation as a direct result of the additional field objects seen.
- Multiple model extended Kalman Filter
- Implemented Goal Keeper behaviour: right dive, left dive, and center
