# Kinematics

## Description

Provides inverse kinematics for left leg, right leg or head. Will emit a Done Task when the corresponding limb is Done.

## Usage

Emit the corresponding IK message as a task.

## Consumes

- `message::actuation::LeftLegIK` with information on the servo gains, torque, time to reach the position and the matrix from the target position for the left foot to the torso.
- `message::actuation::RightLegIK` with information on the servo gains, torque, time to reach the position and the matrix from the target position for the right foot to the torso.
- `message::actuation::HeadIK` with information on the servo gains, torque, time to reach the position and the vector that the head should look.

## Emits

- `message::actuation::LeftLeg` with servo control information for each servo in the left leg.
- `message::actuation::RightLeg` with servo control information for each servo in the right leg.
- `message::actuation::Head` with servo control information for each servo in the head.
- `Done` when the limb Tasks are Done.

## Dependencies

- `utility/actuation/InverseKinematics.hpp` provides the IK functions

# Servos

## Description

Takes specific servo requests and emits a ServoTarget for them. Uses Director DSL such that each servo can only be accessed by one Provider at a time.
Individual Servo Providers are Done when their finish time is reached.
Limb Providers are Done when all of the Servos in the Limb are Done.
Sequence Providers run a sequence of Limbs one after the other. They are done when the final Limb is Done.

## Usage

Emit a servo, limb or sequence task, with priority to run according to the Director algorithm.

## Consumes

- Servo messages from `message/actuation/Servos.proto`.
- Limb messages from `message/actuation/Limbs.proto`, which will then emit Servo Tasks from `message/actuation/Servos.proto` to be consumed as above.
- Sequence messages from `message/actuation/Limbs.proto`, which will then emit Limb Tasks from `message/actuation/Limbs.proto` to be consumed as above.

## Emits

- `message::actuation::ServoTarget` the servo control information for the platform module.
- Servo messages from `message/actuation/Servos.proto` when a `message/actuation/Limbs.proto` is received.
- Limb messages from `message/actuation/Limbs.proto` when a Sequence message from `message/actuation/Limbs.proto` is received.

## Dependencies

# FootController

## Description

Skill which corrects the foot orientation to level it with the ground. The correction of the foot can be disabled in the
config and the module will request the given orientation without correction.

## Usage

Include this module to allow the robot to control the feet of robot.

## Consumes

- `message::actuation::ControlLeftFoot` Task requesting the left leg is moved to desired pose.
- `message::actuation::ControlRightFoot` Task requesting the right leg is moved to desired pose.

## Emits

- `message::actuation::LeftLegIK` Task requesting the left leg is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing left leg motion information.
- `message::actuation::RightLegIK` Task requesting the right leg is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing right leg motion information.

## Dependencies

- Eigen
