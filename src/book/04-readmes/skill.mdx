- `message::input::Sensors` to get the current head angles for smoothing

### Emits

- `message::actuation::HeadIK` to calculate and request head joint angles

### Dependencies

- The coordinates utility

## QuinticWalk

### Description

Open loop walk engine that uses quintic splines to create trajectories.

### Usage

Include this module to allow the robot to walk.

### Consumes

- `message::skill::Walk` A Task requesting to walk, containing a vector with the desired velocity target.

### Emits

- `message::behaviour::state::Stability` to indicate when the robot is walking (dynamically stable) and standing.
- `message::actuation::LeftLegIK` Task requesting the left leg is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing left leg motion information.
- `message::actuation::RightLegIK` Task requesting the right leg is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing right leg motion information.
- `message::actuation::LeftArm` Task requesting the left arm is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing left arm servo commands.
- `message::actuation::RightArm` Task requesting the right arm is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing right arm servo commands.

### Dependencies

- KinematicsModel
- Sensors
- `utility::motion::splines::*`

## GPT

### Description

A module that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to send text prompts and receive generated responses.

### Usage

Include this module to allow your system to interact with OpenAI's GPT for natural language processing tasks.

### Consumes

- `message::skill::GPTChatRequest`: A request containing text that needs to be processed by GPT.

### Emits

`message::skill::Say`: A Task requesting to speak using the output of the GPT model based on the input request.

### Dependencies

- **nlohmann::json**: For JSON data serialization and deserialization.
- **utility::openai::openai**: A utility to interface with the OpenAI API.

## Walk

### Description

Open loop walk engine that uses quintic splines to create swing foot and torso trajectories.

### Usage

Include this module to allow the robot to walk.

### Consumes

- `message::skill::Walk` A Task requesting to walk, containing a vector with the desired velocity target.

### Emits

- `message::behaviour::state::Stability` to indicate when the robot is walking (dynamically stable) and standing.
- `message::actuation::ControlLeftFoot` Task requesting the left leg is moved to desired pose.
- `message::actuation::ControlRightFoot` Task requesting the right leg is moved to desired pose.
- `message::actuation::LeftArm` Task requesting the left arm is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing left arm servo commands.
- `message::actuation::RightArm` Task requesting the right arm is moved using Inverse Kinematics, containing right arm servo commands.

## ScriptKick

### Description

Executes a script for kicking.

### Usage

Emit a Kick message when wanting to kick.

### Consumes

`message::skill::Kick` the kick information to use when kicking.

### Emits

`message::actuation::LimbsSequence` through the Script extension, which populates the requested Script/s into LimbsSequences.

### Dependencies

- Script extension

## SplineKick

### Description

SplineKick module executes a kicking motion using splines for smooth and accurate movement. Waypoints for the kicking
foot and torso relative to the support foot are specified in the config and executed by this module.

### Usage

- `message::input::Sensors` to determine which get up script to execute

### Emits

- `message::behaviour::state::Stability` to update the stability when starting and finishing getting up
- `message::actuation::BodySequence` as a Task containing the script sequence for getting up

### Dependencies

- The `Script` extension to convert scripts into BodySequences

## Say

### Description

Module that enables the robot to vocalize specified text using a text-to-speech tool and optionally perform a nodding gesture to indicate speaking.

### Usage

Include this module whenever the robot needs to vocalize or acknowledge messages via speech-like actions.

### Consumes

- `message::skill::Say`: A Task requesting to vocalize a text string. Contains the text to be spoken and an optional nod gesture request.

### Emits
